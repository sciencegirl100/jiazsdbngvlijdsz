Here be the UNofficial duties of the Secretary.. well, in the eyes of
the current (Jan '14) secretary..

The only guidance I (David Mc.) was given upon taking this position was
to take notes at the meetings. Having been in this position for a while,
I'm certain that was an inadequate description. So here's a list of
things I think the Secretary should be responsible for..

- Primary, but not sole, 'handler' for incoming emails on info@hacdc.org

:\* Mostly this means either deleting things or forwarding them on to
the Blabber list.. sometimes it means longer conversations, particularly
with other groups around the world trying to start a hacker-space.

:\* Always be positive and promote openness, learning, and growth.

- Governance of the wiki

:\* Not necessarily watching the wiki software, but definitely taking
lead on the wiki's flow and standards

- NEW: no one ever mentioned this, but I think it's a good idea for the
  Sec to keep the calendar updated with happenings not only from within
  HacDC, but from the general community

:\* ..actually I'm just starting this now (Jan '14), it never occurred
to me before, but I think it'll help people engage.

- Yes, keep the minutes of the meetings.. b/c no one else will, and it
  sounds like we should.
- While I have never had to say anything.. keep an eye on what
  conversations are in Members vs Blabber. Roughly, I default to
  Blabber, unless it's something that only members could act upon.
- Never forget that the Board's primary mission is to keep out of the
  way.
- Just in case ya' missed it, Board members are expected to participate
  in the monthly meetings. I'd say missing one out of the year is ok.
- There's a bit of confusion regarding new members.. The Sec. is
  supposed to get their email and ID, but the Treasurer is the one that
  needs this info. This really hasn't been worked out.
- Keep an eye on who is in the various groups, specifically Members and
  BOD. Remove those that have left.
