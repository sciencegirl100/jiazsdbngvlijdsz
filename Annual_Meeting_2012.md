# Officer Reports

## President's Report

Not present.

## Vice President's Report

Has some ideas for events and stuff to be mentioned later.

XLaser mentioned the would send us another package of laser stuff, but
never did. (Sharks with freaking laser beams.)

## Treasurer's Report

Currently have 59 voting members so quorum is still 14 for now.

Here is the financial summary spreadsheet for Jan 2012:
![<file:HacDC_Financials_Jan_2012.pdf>](HacDC_Financials_Jan_2012.pdf "file:HacDC_Financials_Jan_2012.pdf")

We added members Scott Robbins and Stephen Nichols in January. Vince was
voted in but has not paid yet as far as I know - please contact me if
this is incorrect! And we added three other membership subscriptions
(Chalk, Hughes, and Myers) but have not voted on them as members yet as
well - maybe this month? Two non-paying members, one hasn't responded
and may be dropping.

We finished January almost \$500 ahead and membership revenue is now \>=
expenses! If this keeps up, HacDC will have some resources to put into
projects again going forward.

## Secretary's Report

Nothing special to report. Haven't been around for a couple months.

## At-Large Directors' Reports

### Toast

Not present.

### Martin

Nothing to report.

# Member Reports

## Brad

Smithsonian Institute has contacted Brad about 3D vision stuff. It would
be cool to have a hackathon here to help out. Talk on Blabber if you're
interested. Would like to have an event where we take pictures of
objects at the Smithsonian, turn them into 3d models, and print them out
with the printers at the space.

## haxwithaxe

- occupancy sensor getting it's own machine (sheevaplug)
- project server on the fritz (might need replacement,more fiddling
  required to know)
- Byzantium gunning for CFP acceptance at HOPE and several other cons
- found HacDC patches with HOPE vulture. i have them in my bag so they
  make it to HOPE for those interested in them.
- working on occsensor controlled outlet to prevent things that
  shouldn't be on when no one is at the space from being on while no one
  is at the space.

## Martin

- noise reduction: status? items/actions/help required? (item added by
  haxwithaxe)
  - got started, will continue to get worked on as time permits

## Alberto

We're going to get some monies for the class that Brad is teaching.
(Let's earmark it for lasers.)

## Eric

Working on fixing up the Internet in the space/church. Might be a
problem with the AP.

Bill has donated an AP which might help with the Internets.

something nice for us.
