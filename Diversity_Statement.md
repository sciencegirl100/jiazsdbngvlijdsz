The following statement was member approved during
[Annual_Meeting_2013](Annual_Meeting_2013 "wikilink").

We welcome you.

We welcome people of any gender identity or expression, race, ethnicity,
size, nationality, sexual orientation, ability level, neurotype,
religion, elder status, family structure, culture, subculture, political
opinion, identity, and self-identification.

As a U.S.- and District of Columbia-based 501(c)(3) non-profit
organization we're obliged to follow applicable laws, but we're serious
about knowing and protecting your rights when it comes to free
expression and privacy.

We support maximum freedom of creative expression, and only restrict
that when we must for the safety and sanity of other folks. We think
creativity is one of the greatest accomplishments of the human mind, and
we want to enable that creativity in everyone from pro to amateur. We
think neurodiversity is a feature, not a bug. We believe in being
inclusive, welcoming, and supportive of anyone who comes to us with good
faith and the desire to build a community.
