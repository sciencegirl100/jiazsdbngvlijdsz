**WARNING: Working on the laser cutter poses hazards far beyond anything
many people have encountered.**

- The laser beam can blind instantly. It is invisible. It can reflect
  unexpectedly. Operating the laser with the cover open (normally
  blocked) is a really bad idea.
- The laser runs off of high power high voltage. Unlike household
  current this can kill you even if you just come close to it. Think
  lightning-in-a-box. Always turn the power switch off and unplug the
  plug at the back of the laser cutter (so you know it's the right one)
  before working on it. In addition, high voltage power supplies can
  hold a charge after they've been turned off so you can still get
  zapped for a while after everything's been shut off. If at all in
  doubt get expert advice.
- Freak accidents happen.
- On the other hand, just using the laser cutter poses far less risk.
  Take standard precautions.

[Cheap Chinese Laser](Cheap_Chinese_Laser "wikilink")

This is the page dealing with the [Cheap Chinese
Laser](Cheap_Chinese_Laser "wikilink") at [HacDC](https://www.hacdc.org)
in the upstairs room at St. Stephen and the Incarnate church in
Washington, DC. This page replaces [PA
LaserCutter](PA_LaserCutter "wikilink") page from some years ago. It had
high ideals, but poor execution.

## Introduction

HacDC has a K40, 40W, CO2, water cooled, laser for CNC cutting of
various materials, aka a cheap Chinese laser. It allegedly used to work
just fine, but someone decided that wasn't good enough so she ordered
and half-ass installed some new parts that only half-ass work. After our
intrepid hero, [James](user:James "wikilink"), fully-assed the
installation of the new parts, the laser still only half-ass worked.
[Tom](user:Tom "wikilink") was railroaded into helping with the
software, but even so the dynamic duo couldn't get the damn thing to
work. Then one day at work, boredom struck in a meeting and James had
the idea to create this wiki page to guide others through the confusion
and misinformation that plagues most equipment at HacDC and often
results in subpar operation. I beseech you, dear reader, to continue
your edification on our topic at hand and become your own evil
arch-villain with laser powers. (Sharks sold separately.)

## Components

### Chassis

The chassis is the laser itself, the blue metal box with 3 flip up lids.

- The main lid users deal with is for the **cutting chamber** on the
  left front of the machine. It includes an orange plastic window. The
  cutting chamber contains the transverse and longitudinal axes, aka X
  and Y. X goes left to right, and Y goes back to front. The material to
  be cut goes in this chamber.
- The second flip up lid is for the **controls and power supplies
  chamber**. This lid contains the front panel controls and indicators.
  There are two control boards, the [Smoothie
  board](http://smoothieware.org/smoothieboard-v1) and the K40 ACR
  plug-and-play board which connects the Smoothie board to the machine
  hardware. There are two power supplies as well, the control power
  supply which is right below the control boards and the high-voltage
  (and I mean real high voltage, like around 15kV, not those namby-pamby
  B.S. 120VAC "high voltage" warning labels) laser tube power supply
  which creates enough voltage to excite the electrons in the CO2
  molecules to a higher energy level so they emit coherent light when
  they drop down to a lower energy level. For more about this exciting
  process, read a science book.
- The third lid covers the **laser tube chamber** at the back of the
  chassis. You don't really need to mess with these last two lids unless
  you are modifying the equipment or troubleshooting a failure. The
  first 2 lids have interlock switches so the laser will not fire if any
  one is open (unless you turn the SAFETIES switch off, in which case,
  it's your own darn fault for burning out your eye; as we say in
  Charlotte, "you did it to yourself") but the laser tube cover does not
  yet (it should; the high voltage is probably the most dangerous thing
  in the space).

### Exhaust

The exhaust system sucks smoke from the laser chassis cutting chamber
and sends it outside through a window. It was cobbled together using a
fan and housing salvaged from a prior laser cutter and is mostly held
together with zipties and metal duct tape. Seriously. I'm not kidding.
Actual zipties and duct tape. (I'd like to give a shout-out to Home
Depot for selling me the roll of metal tape for only one cent.) If any
part of the whole laser system is going to crap out, this would be a
good part to bet on. It also uses 4" diameter (that's 105mm for those of
you on the metric system) flexible metal clothes dryer exhaust duct to
carry the exhaust gasses. There are custom-made, 3d-printed transiton
pieces at the back of the laser chassis which replace the original
feeble exhaust system. Read about them on the [K40 Exhaust
Assembly](K40_Exhaust_Assembly "wikilink") page.

### Cooling

The cooling system presently consists of a 5 gallon pail in the roller
cabinet with a submersible pump. The water should be replaced with
distilled. (The pump power cord got a new plug. It stays plugged in much
better than the original cheap Chinese plug.) If the water doesn't flow,
the laser will burnout. Sadness. The cooling system presently only works
based on the heat capacity of the water in the bucket. Once the water
heats up, you just need to wait for it to cool back down all by itself.
You can read about other people with more sophisticated refrigerated
cooling systems, but this was quick and easy, like a virgin on prom
night. Julia has mentioned she's got some thermoelectric coolers in
hiding for this project. We'll cross that bridge when we get everything
else running first. The cooling system will have 3 interlocks: low water
level, low flow, and high temperature.

### Computer

This is CNC equipment. The first C is for Computer. (No, not for cookie,
but we often have cookies anyway.) You need a computer with a USB port.
You need computer software. I hope we can have a computer dedicated to
the laser, but let's be real, that's not likely to happen. I hope Tom
will fill out this section.

### Software

Hey, kids! [Ubuntourist](user:Ubuntourist "wikilink") here. In the
software department, we are using a
[LaserWeb](https://github.com/LaserWeb/LaserWeb4/wiki) AppImage
(currently version 4.0 as of 2018.09). However, additional tools
include:

- [VisiCut](http://visicut.org/) - a user-friendy, platform-independent
  tool for preparing, saving and sending jobs to Lasercutters
- [GCodeTools](http://www.cnc-club.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?t=35) -
  Inkscape plugin / extension
  - [Usage
    "Manual"](http://www.cnc-club.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?p=101#p101)
  - [Tutorial: Area
    processing](http://www.cnc-club.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?p=341#p341)
  - [Tutorial: Make some gears using Gcode tools and Gear
    extension](http://www.cnc-club.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?p=194#p194)

### Cabinet

The cabinet is what the chassis sits on. The cabinet has wheels. It's
made of particle board and painted white. The left door has upper and
lower latches inside which hold it shut, so don't yank on it. The
cabinet houses the cooling system, the 12V accessory power supply, the
power strip which all the line voltage equipment plugs into: exhaust
fan, cooling pump, laser chassis, 12V power supply (marginal one
installed currently to power the cutting chamber accessory lights).

## Safety Interlocks

**Only some of these safeties (cutting chamber cover, control cover, &
water level) are installed presently.** Don't go futzing around with
stuff unless you know exactly what you are doing. And tell James or Tom.
For troubleshooting purposes, there is a safety override switch on the
control panel (SAFETIES; middle of three).

### Ventilation

1.  Exhaust - If the exhaust fan isn't moving air, we don't want the
    laser to fire and make lots of smoke which would then fill the room
2.  Lens - Eventually we plan to install an air shroud nozzle around the
    laser lens to keep smoke from coating the lens and reducing cutting
    power.

### Coolant

1.  Level - Installed
2.  Flow
3.  Temp

### Doors

1.  Cutting Chamber - Installed
2.  Control Chamber - Installed
3.  Laser Chamber - Probably not going to install this switch because
    the door is in back and control panel space is at a premium
4.  Cabinet - Probably not going to install this switch because there's
    not much harm in the cabinet and control panel space is at a premium

## Workflow

### Prestart

## Custom Wiring

Julia had some LED strips she wanted installed. We succeeded. They
illuminate when the main power is turned on.
![<File:Laser-leds1.jpg>](Laser-leds1.jpg "File:Laser-leds1.jpg")

They are white LEDs but the orange laser viewing window colors them.

Sully really likes relays and discrete, analogue circuits, so he jimmied
up a bunch of stuff to make it less likely for you to poke your eye out
or burn out the laser.

The laser power supply from the factory takes input from 3 front panel
controls: off-on laser switch, momentary-on laser switch, power control
potentiometer knob. The off-on switch was a cheap latching push button
which was connected to the leftmost two terminals of the 6 terminal plug
with black wires. It was replaced with an off-on, metal, toggle switch
on 3-23-17. The middle two terminals of the block connect to the
momentary on push button switch on the front panel which causes the
laser to fire (when the left two terminals are shorted together by the
toggle switch). The right 3 terminals (which overlap with the right
center terminal going to the push button switch) connect to the front
panel potentiometer which controls the laser current. Do not turn the
knob to full clockwise, because increasing the laser firing current past
a certain point doesn't provide any benefit and just reduces the tube
lifespan. The plan is to parallelize the push button firing switch with
a solid-state relay controlled directly by the Smoothie board and
bypassing the K40 ACR board (which was supposed to make the Smoothie
board plug-and-play, but as mentioned earlier did a halfassed job). The
potentiometer will be connected to a 3PDT switch for computerized or
manual power level control. A PWM to DC circuit will do the automatic
control and the original pot will remain for the manual control.

The safety interlocks are basically a whole bunch of microswitches in
series so if any one of them gets tripped the left two pins of the power
supply 6 pin connector won't be shorted together and the laser won't
fire. There's also a plan to have lights illuminate to show which
safeties are operating properly or tripped. Plus indicator lights are
cool. And for the remaining manual firing switches we plan on getting
those flip-up red covers like in those military movies where they're
firing nuclear missiles and stuff like that. These would aid in
troubleshooting, and look really cool, even if they are kinda spendy.
Man, this is really turning into a wall of text. Someone should do
something about this sometime. Anyway, schematic drawings would go here,
or links to them would go here.

| Work on firing up the laser directly from smoothieboard pinouts PWM and TTL. TTL (1.30) to Laser LO and PWM (2.4) to 5v control. Problem: PWM out looks like it is 3.3v logic.

Removed and put-back small laser fire wire and ground to the smoothieboard. This appeared to fix laser autofire issue. Not 100% sure about that. Removed 2nd and 3rd mirror to find them damaged. Took photos and sought advice on their state. Put mirrors back in place but alignment is needed. Best to wait for new mirrors in the meantime.                                                                                                                                  |

Mirror 1 should probably be checked at some point as well. Adjusted the alignment on mirrors 1 and 2. Reduced the torque on the adjustment screws to 'finger-tight'. Alignment on 3rd mirror is dead centre across the entire bed. This should improve cutting power across the entire range. Might be worth ordering another set of spare mirrors and a lens for future repairs. Laser appears to fire correctly, respecting interlocks and fire control. |

Sept. 1, 2018 - Independent examination revealed multiple issues: 1.
Closed loop in wiring - resolved (A loop can act like a transformer and
couple noise into the wiring.) Removed. 2. AUTO/MAN switch did not
affect control of laser firing, only laser current - partially resolved
(This may explain unexpected firing of laser.) Rewired so FIRE switch
has no effect in AUTO mode and controller cannot fire laser while in MAN
mode. However, setting switch on MAN does not stop the controller; it
can continue moving the mirrors and could resume firing the laser the
instant the switch is returned to AUTO. Therefore, always HALT AUTOMATIC
OPERATION BEFORE USING MANUAL CONTROL. 3. A loose connection around the
Laser Current meter could result in deadly high voltage appearing in the
control circuitry - resolved Added shunt diode to clamp voltage to \<1V.
4. Interlock switches not connected - resolved Connected (cutting
chamber door, electronics cover, water level). Terminal block positions
10 & 11 are allocated for additional switches. 5. Missing interlock
switches - not resolved (laser tube cover, water flow, & water
temperature) New wiring is color coded (but old wiring is not): Black -
ground connection Green - safety switches White - control & temporary
Some of the wiring is rather sloppy and should probably be redone once
all the bugs are out of it. A loose wire to the power socket & the
exhaust duct (may have just come loose) were also reconnected. The laser
cutter should now be ready for testing by an expert. Oops, left out 6.
No manual control for laser position - unresolved Sept. 3 Tom showed up
to test the laser cutter. It fired under manual control but the safeties
did not stop it from firing. Tried other firing pin (C3) - same result.
Completely disconnected wire to enable pin (C2) & then also tried
disconnecting the diode I added - laser still fired, suggesting faulty
power supply. Laser did not move in y direction when commanded by
computer but moved in both x & y when commanded to move in x direction.
Tom moved a connector on the ACR board - problem solved. Mirrors now
move correctly under computer control but computer could not fire laser.
Left with enable disconnected. Time to examine power supply schematic.
