## Summary

We have failed to achieve [quorum](quorum "wikilink") (50%) at all of
our meetings held since introducing the charter members. As
[quorum](quorum "wikilink") is necessary to pass member resolutions,
authorize budgets, etc. it is vital that we solve this problem so we go
back to having meetings with binding resolutions.

## Potential Solutions

- Amending the Bylaws to lower [quorum](quorum "wikilink") to 25%
  - Pros:
    - Simple: Lowering [quorum](quorum "wikilink") changes only one
      rule, keeps all other scheduling, procedures, customs, etc. in
      place.
    - Keeps the space active, members know there is one time a week when
      people will be at the space.
    - Allows business to be handled weekly
    - Encourages discussions to happen in an ongoing manner through the
      wiki, mailing list, and other means.
  - Cons:
    - Those who show up to meetings more regularly tend to exercise more
      influence over HacDC than those who can't make meetings regularly.
    - Could lead to decisions being made by a determined minority of the
      membership

- Amending the Bylaws to allow for monthly, as opposed to weekly
  meetings
  - Pros:
    - Relatively simple (changes another rule in the bylaws)
    - Encourages larger gatherings of members
  - Cons:
    - Business could be postponed for several months if
      [quorum](quorum "wikilink") fails to materialize
    - Could still fail to get [quorum](quorum "wikilink")
    - Leads to date confusion, rescheduling for member convenience, etc.
    - Restricts handling business to a monthly schedule
    - (Note: These were reasons given by other hacker spaces who changed
      to monthly meetings then changed back.)

- Amending the Bylaws to allow for a virtual meeting solution
  - Pros:
    - Allows members to participate from anywhere
    - Allows business to be handled anytime
  - Cons:
    - Very high barriers in terms of functionality, usability, resource
      drain, etc.
    - Uses time/resources compared to other potential solutions
    - Encourages "voting" as opposed to informed consensus building
    - Discourages gatherings in "real space", one of the points of
      HacDC.

## PROPOSAL

The following Amendment Proposal Petition is submitted for approval at
this meeting:

Amend Article III, Section 5 of the Bylaws of HacDC to read:

At a duly called meeting, at least 25% (one quarter) of the entire
voting membership shall constitute a [quorum](quorum "wikilink").

This proposal, in accordance with the bylaws, must be approved at a
membership meeting and signed by more than three quarters (3/4ths) of
voting members.

Once approved, written notice of such petition must be submitted
electronically to all members and delivered to all members of the
corporation physically in person or by registered mail to take effect.

## Status

The above proposal was passed.
