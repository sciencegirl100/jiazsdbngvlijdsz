## Types

There are several things that can cause built in mic sensitivity to be
inadequate.

- some batches have mic gain that is too high caused by poorly adjusted
  trim pots
- some have it too low due to the same reason
- some have something wrong in the MCU that keeps the gain too low
- some have misaligned case isolation bushing that cover the pin prick
  mic hole in the case

## Bushing/Case Fix

1.  invoke your inner caveman
2.  remove the front panel of the case
3.  widen the mic hole in the front panel to ~2mm or 3mm (a pocket knife
    does fine)
4.  reassemble and test. if it works well stop here else keep going
5.  remove the front case panel and remove the rubber boot over the
    electrilet mic.
6.  use a knife or a hole punch to widen the hole without removing the
    entire flat face (which is there to help reduce vibrations in the
    case from getting to the mic).
7.  reassemble and test if it didn't work it is probably something else
    or a combination of this and something else.
