"They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary
safety deserve neither liberty nor safety." -Benjamin Franklin,
Franklin's Contributions to the Conference on February 17 (III) Fri, Feb

# Anonymity/Privacy?

Q: What is anonymity? A: In the context of security anonymity refers to
the inability of unauthorized parties to link communications to your
"real" identiy in whatever for that may take. This can also work on a
sliding scale such as "Can my
<crazy stalker/local law enforcement/federal law enforcement> find me?".
The answer of yes for the "crazy stalker" will be significantly easier
to achieve than the yes for "federal law enforcement". Q: What is
privacy? A: Privacy is the ability to expose your information or
behavior to only those parties you wish to share it with. This does not
inherently include the ability to obscure your identity.

Anonymity and privacy are complementary to each other in many cases but
are not mutually inclusive.

# SSL

Why SSL is broken: <http://notary.icsi.berkeley.edu/trust-tree/> The red
circles on that map are the "root CAs", the Certificate Authorities that
have their certificate trusted in most browsers. The size of the circle
is based on the amount of certificates the CA is thought to have issued.
These are all the entities that if one gets hacked, they can issue a
wildcard certificate and your browser would show the certificate as
valid.

# GPG

# TOR

What is TOR and why does it matter?

What is TOR from the EFF (https://www.eff.org/torchallenge/what-is-tor):
Tor is a service that helps you to protect your anonymity while using
the Internet. Tor is comprised of two parts: software you can download
that allows you to use the Internet anonymously, and the volunteer
network of computers that makes it possible for that software to work.

When you use the Tor software, your IP address remains hidden and it
appears that your connection is coming from the IP address of a Tor exit
relay, which can be anywhere in the world. There are many reasons you
might use Tor, including keeping websites from tracking you and your
family members, using websites or services which are blocked in your
country (for example, getting around the Great Firewall of China), and
maintaining anonymity when communicating about socially sensitive
information, such as health issues or whistleblowing. Learn more about
who uses Tor.

# Hard Drive Encryption

## Truecrypt (Windows drive encryption)

How to encrypted your system drive (Windows boot drive) on Windows using
Truecrypt:

# Suggested Software:

Software usable under multiple operating systems is normally listed
under each operating system.

Note about Truecrypt-No complete audit has been done yet, people are
currently collecting funds for a full audit -
