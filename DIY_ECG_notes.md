## Overview

Here are notes for myself and others interested in building DIY ECG
equipment. There are many ways to skin this particular err.. project,
from crude to incredibly complex. Here are lists of parts, websites,
theory, etc.

Page maintained by [User:Obscurite](User:Obscurite "wikilink") who is
working on his own ECG equipment. Enjoy.

## PARTS for higher-precision version(s)

- Instrumentation Amplifiers (not sure why these are priced so
  differently)
  - Both have CMMR of 110+ for gain of 1000, so they should both work
    equally well. AD624AD is referenced in the sciam article, but it
    also mentions the AD620A which is 1/3 the cost at about \$7.
  - Cheaper version:
    [AD620A](http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail&name=AD620ANZ-ND)
  - Expensive version:
    [AD624AD](http://parts.digikey.com/1/parts/453660-ic-amp-inst-25mhz-prec-ln-16cdip-ad624ad.html)
- Better op amp - OP97 (need to review data sheet)

## PARTS for basic version(s)

- LM358 (dual opamp) or LM324 (quad opamp), or LF353 (which is pin
  compatible)
- Diodes
- 0.1uF capacitor(s)
- Variety of 1/4 watt resistors (10k, 100k, etc)
- shielded wires for electrodes (phone or coax cables)
- electrodes (soldered pennies, medical electrodes, etc)
- diodes (1N4001)

## Microcontrollers and FPGAs

- Atmel atmega168/328 has onboard ADC
- Xilinx Spartan3E dev board has built in ADC
