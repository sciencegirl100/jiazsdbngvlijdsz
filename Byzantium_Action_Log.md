If you contribute to the Byzantium project in anyway (including
intellectually) please add a brief (if it's more than 280 characters
consider linking to a separate page) entry to this page or have someone
with edit access to this page in the following format. If there is an
objection to an entry it can always be removed so don't be afraid to
write something. If you don't want to be identified you can use the name
"Anonamoose" or anything else you want (but Anonymoose is the best
choice :P). Try to keep it in roughly chronological order if you can but
close is good enough ([haxwithaxe](User:haxwithaxe "wikilink") will
probably rewrite the page after running it through sort occasionally).

## Log

### 2011

- 2011/09/30 - group - byzantium planning meeting: discussed use cases,
  routing between meshes with nonmesh clients, prepared to finalize the
  development (pre-pre-alpha) build of the live distro
- 2011/10/01 - haxwithaxe - made this page for people to record their
  contributions
- 2011/10/01 - group - byzantium sprint day: TBD
- 2011/7/9 - drwho - Set up <http://svn.virtadpt.net/byzantium> for
  Porteus modules
  - Started coding web control panel for Byzantium
  - Converted Slackware v13.37 packages into Porteus modules
  - Converted Slackware packages from slackbuilds.org into Porteus
    modules.
  - Packaged web apps into Porteus modules.
  - Tested package compilation using the scripts Ben and Chris wrote.
    Noted the ones that worked, opened tickets in the [bug
    tracker](https://github.com/Byzantium/Byzantium/issues) for the ones
    that didn't, tried to include enough information to help figure out
    what's going wrong in the package builder.
- 2022/11/13 - drwho - Figured out how to put together a fakeroot
  directory structure that could then be used to build
  000-byzantium.xzm. This is the core module of Byzantium Linux.
  - Put together the 000-byzantium.xzm module for demonstration as an
    alpha release.
  - Debugged rc.setup_mysql initscript so that it sets up the necessary
    application MySQL databases on an instance of Byzantium and locks it
    down. It's also extensible enough to build new functionality on
    later.
