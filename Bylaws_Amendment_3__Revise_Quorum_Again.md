Under Article III, Section 4 of the current [Bylaws](Bylaws "wikilink"):


At a duly called meeting, at least 25% (one quarter) of the entire
voting membership shall constitute a quorum.

This value was lowered from 50% by [Bylaws Amendment 1: Revise
Quorum](Bylaws_Amendment_1:_Revise_Quorum "wikilink").

We hereby propose that this section of the [Bylaws](Bylaws "wikilink")
be amended to read:


At a duly called meeting, at least 20% (one fifth) of the entire voting
membership shall constitute a quorum.

This value was lowered from 25% by [Bylaws Amendment 3: Revise Quorum
Again](Bylaws_Amendment_3:_Revise_Quorum_Again "wikilink").

## Status

The above proposal has not yet been approved at a membership meeting or
signed by more than three quarters (3/4ths) of voting members as needed
to take effect.
