- Download a copy of [Porteus Linux](http://porteus.org).
  - Install it to a USB key or virtual machine, depending on your
    preference. Use the official Porteus instructions to do so.
- Set up an account at [Github](https://github.com) and start watching
  [Project Byzantium](https://github.com/Byzantium/Byzantium).
  - This will let you not only watch the project's activity from your
    Github dashboard, but if you join the project you'll be able to
    check code in.
  - You'll also be able to open new tickets in the bug tracker, and
    comment on existing ones.
- Check out a copy of the source code: **git clone
  <git://github.com/Byzantium/Byzantium.git>**
  - Now you'll have all of the code we've written.
  - To update your local checkout, change to the Byzantium directory and
    run the command **git pull**.
  - If you just want to try the latest build of Byzantium, download [the
    Byzantium
    module](http://svn.virtadpt.net/byzantium/000-byzantium.xzm) and
    copy it into the directory */porteus/modules/* on your USB key or in
    your virtual machine after you've booted it. The module will be
    automatically activated the next time it's booted.
    - Note that 000-byzantium.xzm isn't updated as often as the source
      code repository is, so it may not be up to date.
- Join the [mailing
  list](http://groups.google.com/a/hacdc.org/group/Byzantium/?hl=en).
  Note that you'll need a Gmail account of some kind.
  - Once you're on the list, post an introduction! Tell us how you found
    out about Byzantium and a little about what you would like to work
    on.
- Pick something to work on!
  - Pick a ticket in the [bug
    tracker](http://svn.virtadpt.net/byzantium/000-byzantium.xzm) and
    fix it. Tell us about it on the mailing list if you don't already
    have commit access and post a patch (**git diff**) if not.
  - Experiment with Byzantium. If you manage to break it somehow, open a
    ticket in the bug tracker and tell us about it. Even better, post a
    fix for it.
