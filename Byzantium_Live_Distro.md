## Description

We are building a portable live Linux distribution based on [Porteus
Linux](http://porteus.org/). Porteus itself is a fork of Slax that has
been brought up to date with Slackware 13.37 and uses a 2.6.38.8 kernel.
Porteus can use binary packages from Slackware 13.37 after conversion to
Porteus' native format.

## Code Repositories

[Github page](https://github.com/Byzantium/Byzantium)

[Subversion repo for Porteus
packages](http://svn.virtadpt.net/byzantium/)

## Goals

- Make it possible for people in emergency situations to communicate and
  collaborate.
- Make it possible for people in areas where the communications
  infrastructure is compromised to communicate and collaborate.
- Provide services to support communication and collaboration.
- Will be secure out of the box.
  - Best practices for isolating running services will be followed.
  - Best practices for configuration web applications will be followed.
  - Least privilege will be followed wherever possible.
- Will be extensively documented.
  - A Creative Commons-licensed book will be made available with the
    Byzantium distribution as well as separately
  - Will explain the finer points of setting up a mesh, as well as
    accompanying projects (such as dialup gateways and long-haul
    transports).
  - Will be translated into as many languages as possible.
- Widely compatible.
  - Users need to be able to boot their desktop/laptop/netbook from
    Byzantium media and set up a node.
  - As little fiddling with network drivers as possible.
- Rapidly deployable.
  - Users need to be able to configure their Byzantium node rapidly and
    with little assistance.
  - Emergency situations.
  - Control panel aims to be as self-documenting as possible.
- Aims to protect confidentiality of traffic.
  - Opportunistic IPsec?
  - All services default to SSLv3/TLSv1.
- Aims to protect integrity of traffic.
  - SSLv3/TLSv1.
- Meshes should grow without the direction of a central authority.
  - Anyone can set up a mesh node.
  - Anyone can set up services on the mesh.
  - Services packaged by default can be managed (activated and
    deactivated) from the control panel
  - Services packaged by default will come preconfigured with secure
    defaults and a mobile-friendly theme where appropriate.
  - This is a calculated risk. The threat models of Tor and I2P take
    this into account as well.
- Byzantium nodes need to be rapidly clonable.
  - One copy of the live distribution needs to become many on demand.
  - Nodes need to be clonable without taking the node down.
- Persistent storage has to be an option.
  - Built into [Porteus](http://porteus.org).
    - save.dat file
    - removable media
    - media Porteus is installed to
- Dependencies will be automatically managed by the control panel.

## Features

- Can support multiple mesh routing protocols.
- Modular configuration back end.
- Multiple pre-packaged, pre-configured web applications for
  communication and collaboration.
- All services can be independently activated and deactivated.
- Aims for security by default.
  - Services are not active unless explicitly triggered.
  - Services are configured using best practices for security.
  - Services support strong cryptography by default.
- Supports gatewaying from the mesh to the Net over a live connection.
- Supports persistent (encrypted) storage on demand (not default).
  - Note: When creating a save.dat file under Porteus, if the drive it's
    on is formatted FAT-32 or less, the file MUST be \<1024MB, else, the
    /linuxrc script that forms the core of the distro will pretend that
    it can't locate the file, regardless of where you put it. This drove
    me bonkers for two months!
    - If possible we should try to make save.dat a second partition on
      the thumbdrive (ala casper-rw for ubuntu liveUSBs) there are some
      big benefits to this:
      - it makes it harder for windows users to see that there is a
        second partition in case big brother decides to inspect the
        contents of all thumbdrives.
      - it means we won't have to worry about file size limits.

Pick a web server to host applications:

- Converted the Apache, apr\*, and PHP packages of Slackware v13.37 into
  Porteus modules. They Just Worked(tm).

~~We need to figure out how to properly install the control panel app on
a new system. The process should be as pythonic as possible.~~

We need to figure out how to bundle the already configured and populated
MySQL databases for the web apps!

- Packaging them into a module and activating it didn't work.
- ~~Write a script that detects the presence or absence of
  /var/lib/db/\*/ and restores them from .sql dumps at boot-time.~~

## Packages built for Byzantium

- babeld - For great mesh routing.
- batman-adv - Kernel module which implements mesh routing at OSI
  layer 2. We may not use it but it's there if we need it.
- batctl - Utility for configurating and manipulating batman-adv.
  - Dependency of batman-adv.
- olsrd - from olsr.org
- ahcpd - For configuring mesh nodes that don't want to use the random
  RFC-1918 IP address generator.
- CherryPy - Python module that implements a fast multi-threaded HTTP
  (web application) server.
  - Without this, there is no control panel.
- pySetupTools - Required for installing some Python modules.
- Mako - Python HTML templating system.
  - Dependency of the control panel.
- MarkupSafe - Python library that implements a Unicode string that is
  aware of HTML escaping rules and does automatic string escaping.
  - Dependency of Mako.
- Git - Converted Slackware v13.37 package.
  - Necessary for checking code out and into Github.
- Curl - Converted Slackware v13.37 package.
  - Dependency of git.
  - Note: To make git work without "error setting certificate verify
    locations" errors, you need to run the following command as the root
    user: git config --system http.sslcainfo
    /usr/share/curl/ca-bundle.crt
- rrdtool - Used by traffic_stats.sh to monitor network traffic and
  build graphs.
- sqlitebrowser - Used to develop SQLite database schemas and debug
  database access code. Will not be in OS release.
- ~~nginx - Lightweight, fast HTTP(S) server. Much more lightweight than
  Apache, at any rate. Custom build for Byzantium.~~
  - Enough!
- gd - Dependency of PHP.
  - Used for server side image manipulation.
- libmcrypt - Dependency of PHP.
- icu4c - International Components for Unicode. i18n dependency of PHP.
- openldap-client - Dependency of PHP to make it compile. Not pleased by
  having to package it, but it won't build without it.
  - Can we get away with not having it because I didn't have to compile
    it for Apache? Let's try it!
- php - Converted Slackware v13.37 package.
- httpd - Apache v2.2.17. Converted Slackware v13.37 package.
  - ..and then stuff started working!
- apr-util - Converted Slackware v13.37 package.
  - Utility used for compiling Apache modules.
- apr - Converted Slackware v13.37 package.
  - Package used for compiling Apache modules.
- t1lib - Converted Slackware v13.37 package. Used for font
  manipulation.
- pcre - Converted Slackware v13.37 package.
  - Perl Compatible Regular Expression library.
  - Unicode aware for i18n support. status.net requires this for basic
    functionality, whcih means that we get i18n for free.
- ~~Firefox v6.0.2~~
  - Do not use! i_can_haz_firefox.sh builds a package with bad symlinks.
    Haven't bothered to fix it so far.
- node - An event-driven I/O server-side JavaScript environment based on
  V8. (from website and wikipedia).
  - Required by Etherpad-lite.
- dnsmasq - All-in-one DHCP and caching DNS server.
  - Much easier to work with in circumstances like this than ISC BIND or
    even djbdns.
- ipcalc - Command-line IP networking calculator. Will be needed by the
  control panel shortly.
  - Removed the CGI-BIN script from the package when it was built.
- ngircd - Lightweight IRC server.
  - Back-end for web chat application.
  - Somehow we need to figure out a way to make them automagically hook
    together into an IRC network. But that can wait.
- zope.interface - Required by Twisted.
- Twisted - Required by qwebirc.
  - Satisfies the clientless web chat requirement.

## Stuff

~~Need to edit /etc/hosts, add 'byzantium' to 127.0.0.1 so that the web
server will start up.~~

[Mobile devices and IPv6.](Mobile_devices_and_IPv6. "wikilink")

~~[DNSmasq](http://thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html)~~

- ~~One nice thing about DNSmasq is the -H option, for additional
  /etc/hosts-like files. We could use those to cache the IP addresses of
  other Byzantium nodes, and then query them for the services they
  run.~~
  - Hostnames are IPv6 addresses of nodes.
    - ifconfig wlan0 \| grep inet6 \| awk '{print \$3}' \| sed 's/:/-/g'
      \| sed 's/\\64\$//' \| sed 's/\$/.byzantium.mesh/' ==
      fe80--21c-bfff-fe35-84c2.byzantium.mesh
  - ~~Put IP addresses and hostnames in /etc/hosts.mesh.~~
  - This could also be used for status.net federation and IRC network
    construction.
- ~~Move the **server=/byzantium.mesh/...** line into the generated
  DNSmasq include file?~~
  - ~~Make the '...' the mesh interface's IP address?~~

<!-- -->

- ~~Consulted with an expert about IP addressing. At first scratch, it
  might be a good idea to stick wtih pseudo-randomly chosen 10/8's.
  Configure the mesh interface for the .1 and give the clients .2-.254.
  I'll re-work the control panel to do that.~~

Need to account for [APIPA](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/APIPA.html)
addressing in the initial set of routes.

- ~~Added for the purpose of making networkconfiguration.py [detect
  whether or not the proposed IP address for the mesh interface is in
  use](http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-duplicate-address-detection-with-arping/).~~
  - Byzantium does this now. It works like a champ.

List of public DNSes that we may wish to fall back upon in the event a
node is made into a gateway:

- [Google Public DNS](https://code.google.com/speed/public-dns/)
- [Public DNS servers](http://www.tech-faq.com/public-dns-servers.html)

## Stuff to consider for later

- Consider adding [Iodine](http://code.kryo.se/iodine/) to Byzantium to
  help tunnel gatewayed traffic onto the Net.
  - Gateway nodes in hostile areas could use Iodine to tunnel traffic
    out.
  - Gateway nodes in non-hostile areas could accept Iodine connections
    to help less fortunate nodes evade censorship.
- Consider adding (http\|proxy)tunnel with simplified usage of some kind
  to allow encapsulating arbitrary data streams in http streams.
- Firewall evasion aids that will work well even in established internet
  censorship systems?
