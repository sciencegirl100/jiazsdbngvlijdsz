Because [IPset](http://ipset.netfilter.org/) is both a userspace utility
and a set of kernel modules, it poses something of a challenge to
compile. Here's how I did it:

- Note that there are two extant versions of IPset that are designed
  with different releases of the Linux kernel in mind:
  - v4.5 is for Linux kernel \>= v2.6.16
  - v6.10 is for Linux kernel \>= v2.6.**35**
    - This version requires that a patch be applied to the kernel to
      implement the IPset functionality before it'll work. Let's try
      this last.
    - The SlackBuild script checked into Git needs to be updated!
- I used [this
  procedure](http://porteus.org/info/docs/51-development/91-compilation-and-usage-of-custom-porteus-kernel.html)
  to compile a Porteus kernel. Note that we're not actually replacing
  000-kernel.xzm, but a fully configured and compiled kernel has to
  exist on the system for IPset to compile. You just have to compile it,
  not install it, not install new modules, and not rebuild
  000-kernel.xzm.
  - Don't forget to run **make modules**!
- Once the kernel is compiled but not installed (on Windbringer running
  VirtualBox this took about five hours) download and uncompress the
  appropriate version of IPset.
- I edited the Makefile to change the value of PREFIX to "/usr". I
  recommend that you do this.
- **su -**
- **make KERNEL_DIR=/path/to/your/compiled/linux-2.6.38.8**
- Pay close attention. If everything goes as planned it won't take long
  to build.
- If you do not start seeing output to the effect of **CC \[M\]
  /home/guest/tmp/ipset-4.5/kernel/ip_set.o** you forgot to run **make
  modules**. IPset will not work.
- Now install the utility and kernel modules into a fakeroot so they can
  be packaged:

` `**`DESTDIR=/tmp/fakeroot make KERNEL_DIR=/path/to/your/compiled/linux-2.6.38.8 install`**

- Now you have to manually package the kernel modules:

` `**`mkdir -p /tmp/fakeroot/lib/modules/2.6.38.8-porteus/extra/`**
` `**`cp /lib/modules/2.6.38.8-porteus/extra/ip* /tmp/fakeroot/lib/modules/2.6.38.8-porteus/extra`**

- If no files exist in the fakeroot directory
  */tmp/fakeroot/lib/modules/2.6.38.8-porteus/extra* then the kernel
  modules will not be packaged and IPset will not work.
- Strip the ipset binary to save space:

` '`*`'strip /tmp/fakeroot/usr/sbin/ipset`*

- If they do exist, build the .xzm package:

` `**`dir2xzm /tmp/fakeroot /tmp/ipset-4.5.xzm`**
