There was a discussion on the mailing list over whether or not it would
be worth putting a wiki on a Byzantium node. Seeing as how our use cases
involve mobile devices, it might not be worth including them because
they're not easy to edit from smartphones or MP3 players. It's easy to
browse a wiki with a good mobile skin, but not so easy to edit text.
Thus, I think we're tabling the notion until later.
