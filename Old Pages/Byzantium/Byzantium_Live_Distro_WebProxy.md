## Suggestions

- Squidproxy
  - (i'm just pulling names out of my ass on this one - haxwithaxe)
  - Squid's got potential. We might also want to consider something like
    polipo because it'll do the same thing, plus filtering out junk to a
    certain extent, plus it's a lot more lightweight than Squid is.
