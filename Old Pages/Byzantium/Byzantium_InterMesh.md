The InterMesh is the network of meshes that is separate from the
internet either functionally (bandwidth/latency limitations) or fully
(completely disconnected).

## Services Needed

All these services need to be distributed throughout the InterMesh.

I think we should err on the side of "Secure by default". To make it
easy to grow the mesh we can't really set up encryption at OSI layers 1
and 2 (getting people to configure that in a hurry isn't going to work,
though we might have some luck if we did with [QR
codes](http://skattertech.com/2011/01/quick-tip-use-a-qr-code-to-share-wifi-passwords-with-android/)).
I think any services offered on the mesh should offer SSL/TLS by default
(we'll have to go with self-signed certs).

- captive portal
  - to let people know about the services we are providing
- Webmail
  - Something that works like
    [privacybox.de](https://privacybox.de/index.en.html) would be ideal
    in that it's got a short learning curve and a UI that's easy to use
    from a smartphone or PDA.
- Twitter equivalent
  - [status.net](http://status.net/)
- Common chat networks
  - AIM compatible eqiv.
  - Gtalk compatible equiv.
  - Facebook chat compatible equiv.
    - In short, IM-over-HTTPS.
  - IRC
    - [Mibbit](http://www.mibbit.com/) or something that works like it.
    - [CryptoCat](https://crypto.cat/) I think we should get in touch
      with the person running this project.
- Collaborative notes
  - Mediawiki
  - Etherpad
- File uploads
  - Image dump ala [Plixi](http://plixi.com/).
- Streaming audio (low priority)
  - Yes, I'd plug my police scanner into my computer and stream what I
    pick up.
- Voice over IP
  - Asterisk
    - Configure a conference bridge that people with softphones can talk
      on.
    - We'll have to test what kind of latency we get with such a setup.
    - Voicemail
    - Microblog-to-speech using Festival?
