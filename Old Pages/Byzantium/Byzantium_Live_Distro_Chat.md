## Options

[crypto.cat](https://crypto.cat) - requires a preshared key for
encrypted sessions but is otherwise robust out of the box [akiscode
p2pchat](http://akiscode.com/projects/p2pchat/) - needs work but could
be made into a webchat and is written in python.

## Ideal Chat Client

- has the ability to do asymetric encryption
- has the ability to work without a server (maybe unrealistic but it
  would be nice)
- if servers are required they can federate with other servers
- is easy to for end users to use
