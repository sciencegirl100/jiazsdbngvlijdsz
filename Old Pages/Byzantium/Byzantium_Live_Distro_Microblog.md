Working on status.net for now. [status.net](http://status.net) isn't
quite what we need and it is much to complex (says haxwithaxe)

recommend we write our own dead simple one with the following features:

- completely anonymous posting (security via the lack thereof :P)
- distributed couchdb-like database backend
- the future ability to sign messages with pgp keys

For the time being, let's set it up. We can code something else later,
but I need *something* to demo (and turn testers loose on). I'll see if
status.net can use SQLite as its back end. Supposedly [the Google Summer
of
Code](http://status.net/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2011#RDBMS_backend)
was supposed to do this in 2011, but I don't know if it actually
happened.
