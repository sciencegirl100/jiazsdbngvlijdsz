**Sprint Dates: Fri 29 April 2011 - Sun 1 May 2011**

## Goals

- Revisit sprint 1
  - Gather metrics to determine efficiency of protocols.
    - Sizes of routing protocols' packets.
    - Number of packets per second/minute/hour transmitted by each
      protocol.
    - Average amount of traffic during normal operation.
  - Determine how many nodes can participate in a mesh before
    responsiveness or bandwidth begin to degrade.

## Stuff To Bring

- anything that can run babel
  - laptops/netbooks
  - desktops with wireless cards
  - openwrt compatible routers (if you're feeling lucky/adventurous)

## Homework

- install babeld on every machine you plan to bring to the sprint
- \[optional\] install a kernel with support for batman-adv on the same
  machines (it's built into the kernel after version 2.6.38+ ) or build
  the modules separate from the kernel
- readup on route and ip/ifconfig commands in linux
- readup on ipv6

## Experiments

- network density
  - hypothesis: if the nodes are positioned very densely, then the
    network quality will degrade.
  - test: position nodes at increasing densities starting with evenly
    distributed nodes at their maximum effective range, and run tests to
    measure network quality at each level of density.
