possible projects:

- Revisit sprint 2 with different methods.
  - Cantenna?
  - Dialup?
    - Pretty easy to test at HacDC by cross-connecting two modems and
      dialing between them.
  - CAT-5e or CAT-6 throws (thanks to John Gillmore)?
  - Bluetooth?
- web replacement (for inside the mesh)
  - Can already set up web servers on the mesh and deploy web apps.
  - distributed status.net (is it already? - Yes through OStatus
    <http://ostatus.org/> )
    - Have a copy of status.net running on a mesh node right now.
    - [Tahrir](https://github.com/sanity/tahrir/wiki)
    - [rstat.us](http://rstat.us/)
  - webmail
    - May we should look into something that works like
      [privacybox.de](https://privacybox.de/).
  - chat proxies/interceptors?
    - aim
    - facebook
    - gtalk (not really any work needed here)
      - Could probably do it with an XMPP server and a web front-end.
- Asterisk server with web front and a couple of confs configured?
