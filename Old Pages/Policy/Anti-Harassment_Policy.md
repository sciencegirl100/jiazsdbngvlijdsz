This policy was approved during the
[Annual_Meeting_2013](Annual_Meeting_2013 "wikilink") by member vote.

*This anti-harassment policy is based on [the example policy from the
Geek Feminism
wiki](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment),
created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers.*

HacDC is dedicated to being a harassment-free hackerspace for everyone.
We do not tolerate harassment of members or visitors in any form.

Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal comments
related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
body size, race, or religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate
intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording;
sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical
contact; unwelcome sexual attention; or violation of any applicable
laws. Members and visitors asked to stop any harassing behavior are
expected to comply immediately.

If a member or visitor engages in harassing behavior, the board of
directors or event organizer may take any action they deem appropriate,
including warning the offender or expulsion from the space or event with
no refund. Members violating these rules may be subject to termination
of their HacDC membership. If you are being harassed, notice that
someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please
contact a member of the board of directors or the event organizer
immediately.

Members of the board of directors and event organizers will happily help
members and visitors contact building security or local law enforcement,
provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to
feel safe and prevent harassment for the duration of their visit at
HacDC. We value your attendance.
