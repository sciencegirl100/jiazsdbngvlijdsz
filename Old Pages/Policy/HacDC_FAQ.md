**HacDC Frequently Asked Questions**

**What is HacDC?**

HacDC is a group of engineers, makers, artisans, crafters, tinkerers,
technologists, and programmers that have collaborated to create a
non-profit organization and space dedicated to technical, artistic and
social collaboration.

**Why does HacDC exist?**

We believe that there should exist a HackerSpace that provides a
physical location to build upon a sense of community that supports
technical, artistic and social collaboration.

**Why should I care?**

If you're made it this far, and you're reading this question, you're
smart enough to know that the creative and innovative process is not
always spontaneous and in fact you realize that a certain level of
creativity and innovation requires a community of peers. HacDC provides
you with a real face-to-face community, where you can meet your creative
and innovative peers in a friendly atmosphere, surrounded by the
resources and tools, to help you spring up your technical ability, your
creativity, and speed up your innovation to a higher level.

**I read all the issues of Phrack; I can do anything, right?**

Umm, you should get out more. Visit HacDC as soon as possible.
