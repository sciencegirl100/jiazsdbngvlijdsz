HacDC strives to be accessible to as many people as possible, but we
know that our physical space has constraints.

We are unfortunately **not** wheelchair accessible ??? there is a flight
of stairs leading up to our space from the red-door entrance to the
building. As a heads-up to folks with sensory processing issues, we are
working to install sound-dampening material in our main gathering room,
but for the time being it can get noisy when there are multiple
conversations going on simultaneously there, as often happens after our
monthly meetings and on (Microcontroller) Monday evenings.
