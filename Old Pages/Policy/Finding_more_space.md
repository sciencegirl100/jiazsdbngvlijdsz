Right now, we're paying \$850/month, all utilities and cleaning
expenses, for the space we have now. Our lease is up in January.

## What would we do with more space?

- Add a woodshop
- Add an audio/visual editing and recording studio
- Add a long-term storage area
- Develop a [storefront](storefront "wikilink")?
- ...

## Space requirements, desires, and considerations

- Cost
- Accessibility to members (particularly via Metro)
- Size
- ...

## Option: More space in the church

[Nick](User:Nickfarr "wikilink") is currently working with the church to
determine where/how/when we would be able to get more space at our
present location. If you are interested in becoming a part of this
discussion, please let him know.

Pros:

- Access to larger meeting and assembly spaces
- Cheap rent
- Relatively central location

Cons:

- The church may want to increase our rent to "market" rates
- We may be missing out on a better deal somewhere else

## Option: Elsewhere

See [SpaceSearch](SpaceSearch "wikilink").

Given that January is quickly approaching (though it may not seem like
it), members are all encouraged to be on the lookout for commercial
spaces that might be suitable for us, both in terms of budget and
functionality. If we can sustain a membership level of 40, given
insurance and build-out considerations, we could very likely afford a
space that (utilities included) is twice what we're paying now. For
every member, add another \$40 (assuming our dues remain at \$50).
