## Main Topics

1\) Introduction to digital logic & design
2) Verilog HDL modeling & testing
3) FPGA's & using them.

We will be taking an approach of reviewing & learning digital design,
implementing designs and methods of formally simulating and verifying
designs before moving into
[FPGA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array)
oriented work. This workshop will be more engineering oriented than
hobbyist/tinkerer oriented.

## Hardware

We'll be covering some FPGA specific topics and projects using real
hardware. The first half of the workshop will cover logic design,
implementation and testing. This will allow people to put off ordering
any hardware until they know that they actually want to pursue FPGA
development, since the dev board I've chosen for this is not cheap but I
feel is robust enough to be a good starting board for this group.

The hardware we'll be using is the Xilinx Spartan 3AN development kit.
This kit is available from a few vendors for 199USD + shipping. This
will be discussed more later on. The kit includes programming cable, and
evaluation copies of some of the Xilinx tools."

## Tools

### Verilog Simulation and Waveform Viewing

Icarus verilog & gtkwave; for doing Verilog compilation, simulation and
waveform viewing. A makefile has been made to simplify the flow for any
exercises and projects we use these tools with. That makefile can be
found [**here**](iverilogmakefile "wikilink"). Instructions for
installing these programs on Mac osX and Ubuntu can be found here:
[**FOSS Verilog tool
installation**](FOSS_Verilog_tool_installation "wikilink")
=== FPGA Toolchain === After we finish up with covering Verilog
modeling, we'll move to the Xilinx ISE Webpack tools and actual work
with FPGAs. This software is available from Xilinx for free, and is
available for Windows and Linux platforms. This will be used for Verilog
compilation, simulation, synthesis of designs, design mapping, place and
routing of designs, bitstream generation and board programming.
Instructions for installing the Xilinx tools on the VM can be found
here:[**Xilinx ISE Installation
Instructions**](Xilinx_ISE_Installation_Instructions "wikilink")
=== Virtual Machine === An OpenSuse Virtual Machine (VMWare based) will
be available for people to use in this course, if they wish. This will
have the icarus verilog tools and GTKwave loaded on it, along with
Firefox, gcc and make. The suseStudio team has encouraged the use of
their VMs in such a manner (teaching workshops). This is being built in
susestudio, and will be available as a live install as well.
When we move over to the Xilinx tools, people will have to download and
install the Xilinx tools by themselves, since that material is
copyrighted. Instructions will be given for doing that.

The VMware VM image is ready (ver 0.5.2) for people to grab if they
wish. [**Get it
here.**](http://susestudio.com/download/d931a0f28972e3505eacf8d0bad28fc0/Digital_Design__FPGA_Workshop_VM_v4.i686-0.5.2.vmx.tar.gz)

The image also works with VirtualBox. Create a new machine, and when it
asks you for a hard drive, select use an existing drive. This takes you
to the hard-drives list dialog box. From there, file..create a new
drive, link it to the .vmdk file, select it, and you're all set. For the
rest, all defaults are ok. (Bother Elliot for hints with VBox.)

There are a few items of note regarding the VM
\* Download is approximately 350MB, the tarball is about 1.5GB in size,
and the virtual disk will expand up to 20gigs dynamically.

- The download link is a virgin, freshly built VM, so you'll be the
  first user booting it up since build.
- There are two users, root and workshop. Both have the password 'linux'
- For the user workshop, ~/scripts/ is included in their \$PATH
- Also, user workshop has a few small files in ~/resources/ including a
  simple upcounter design example.
- May need to run the network configuration tools to ensure you get
  functional networking. I've experienced issues with the VM in suspend
  mode, switching networks on the host machine, and completely loosing
  network on the VM until rerunning the network config tools. They can
  be found poking around in the system settings for yast.
- Currently, the Xilinx Cable Drivers aren't building on the VM (but all
  the other Xilinx tools work). If someone is a linux guru and wants to
  try to make it work, contact me at <teachmeFPGA@gmail.com>. My next
  attempt is to turn the vm into a live-install and try building the
  cable drivers on real hardware instead of a VM.
- After loading the Xilinx settings (which will be covered in more
  detail when those tools are introduced), the current shell can no
  longer run icarus verilog flows. Start a new shell in order to run
  icarus verilog.
- Its a fairly minimalist system, with the FOSS tools listed above load,
  along with firefox, gcc and nano. Use yast or yast2 in order to
  install any additional packages. example yast2 --install *packname*
- If the download link stops working, the build has likely expired on
  the SuseStudio server. Please email <teachmeFPGA@gmail.com> if the
  download link no longer works.
- Mad props to the susestudio team for making this possible

## Workshop requirements

This workshop will be free of charge to attend, but there are additional
needs in order to fully benefit from attending the workshop.

- Open mind to learning
- Willingness to read documentation, as the capacity for independent
  research is important for doing hardware design.
- Willingness to commit time over this fall
- Either ability to run a VMWare virtual machine, the ability to convert
  the VM for virtualBox, or ability to install the icarus
  verilog/gtkwave tools on your own. This will likely necessitate a
  laptop of some sort.
- Xilinx.com account, for licensing Xilinx tools and IP.
- Hardware will NOT be required at the beginning of the course but will
  be needed later on to run exercises and to do any interesting projects

## Workshop Frequently Asked Questions

1.  What operating systems will the FPGA toolchain be available on?
    1.  The Xilinx ISE Webpack is supported on Windows XP Pro, Windows
        Vista Business, Redhat Linux and Suse Linux Enterprise. For a
        detailed list of official OS support, check out the [Operating
        system support page on
        Xilinx.com](http://www.xilinx.com/ise/ossupport/index.htm). The
        tools will run on openSuse as well. Feel free to try other linux
        distros and post your results.
2.  What is the cost of the FPGA development board we'll be using?
    1.  The retail cost of the development board is typically around
        199-220 USD, plus shipping, from a few different vendors. Links
        for that are
        [here](FPGA_Workshop#Spartan_3AN_Starter_Kit "wikilink").
3.  Will there be homework?
    1.  Since this isn't an academic course, there will not be graded
        homework in the traditional sense. I'll be choosing a few
        additional exercises that people can do outside of the workshop
        each week, if they wish, that will further help hone their
        skills.
4.  Will there be extensive C/C++ coding?
    1.  C experience is not a prerequisite for this workshop. There will
        not be any C/C++ coding involved in the workshop directly. There
        is one project that I've got in mind that may be of interest to
        people that are proficient in C/C++ and pick up hardware design
        rather well.
