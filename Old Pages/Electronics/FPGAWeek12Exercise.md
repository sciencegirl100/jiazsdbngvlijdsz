- Download the Frequency Counter and Frequency Generator reference
  designs from
  <http://www.xilinx.com/products/boards/s3estarter/reference_designs.htm>
- Download the Picoblaze processor core from
  <http://www.xilinx.com/products/ipcenter/picoblaze-S3-V2-Pro.htm>
- Unzip these projects & picoblaze source to your ~/Projects directory
  (or appropriatlely)
- Implementing the projects directly
  - Each project comes with a .bit file that you can use to program the
    FPGA starter kit with. Use impact to program the chip.
  - On Windows, you can run the install batch scripts to run impact
    automatically.
  - Find a buddy with a board, and each of you program your respective
    boards. Grab an SMA cable and use that to check the output of the
    generator with the counter.
- Implementing the projects through ISE
  - Implementing the frequency counter
    - In the frequency counter folder, there is a pdf. It is the readme
      for the project. It will be your friend - it details how to
      quickly run the project, setup the ISE project, design details for
      the hardware and picoblaze software, and some more project ideas.
    - In ISE, create a new design called "s3e_ref_freq_count" in your
      ~/Projects directory.
    - Add the existing .vhd and .ucf sources from the frequency counter
      reference design folder that you unzipped
    - Add the existing .vhd source for kcpsm3.vhd from the picoblaze
      VHDL source folder
    - A portion of the design uses a undocumented mode of operation for
      the S3E DCM. Instructions for enabling this can be found in the
      dcm_fixed_osc.vhd file. In my experience, this breaks P&R (-will),
      and this should be removed in order to complete the design. The
      DCM is simply working in an free-running oscillator mode; this is
      merely used to provide a frequency source for testing and its
      removal will not adversely affect the design.
      - You'll need to modify the **frequency_counter.vhd** file in the
        project, to remove the instance of 'dcm_fixed_osc.vhd' from the
        design. We won't be doing anything in-depth with VHDL so don't
        be intimidated by the different language syntax.
      - You'll want to comment out the component dcm_fixed_osc (approx
        line 117) . In VHDL, comments are done with double hypens, --.
      - Commented out component

<!-- -->

    --
    -- Fixed frequency oscillator using a DCM
    --
    --component dcm_fixed_osc
    --  port(    clk_out : out std_logic;
    --        kick_start : in std_logic   );
    --  end component;

- - The instantiation of the dcm_fixed_osc needs to be commented out
    (approximately line 223)
  - Commented portion

<!-- -->

    --  dcm_fixed_oscillator: dcm_fixed_osc
    --  port map (    clk_out => dcm_oscillator,
    --             kick_start => source_control(7) );

- - Now we'll need to change the multiplexer. To keep the design nearly
    intact, we'll replicate the ring oscillator signal twice (approx
    line 245).
  - Changed multiplexer

<!-- -->

    freq_for_measurement <= sma_clk when (source_control(1 downto 0)="00")
                         else clk_50mhz when (source_control(1 downto 0)="01")
                         else ring_oscillator when (source_control(1 downto 0)="10")
                         else ring_oscillator;

- - Select the top level module, and take it through the implementation
    process - synthesis, place and route, generate programming file.
  - Use impact to program the .bit file to the FPGA! It should
- - Implementing the frequency generator
    - In the frequency generator folder, there is a pdf. It is the
      readme for the project. It will be your friend - it details how to
      quickly run the project, setup the ISE project, design details for
      the hardware and picoblaze software, and some more project ideas.
    - In ISE, create a new design called "s3e_ref_freq_ref" in your
      ~/Projects directory.
    - Add the existing .vhd and .ucf sources from the frequency ref
      reference design folder that you unzipped
    - Add the existing .vhd source for kcpsm3.vhd from the picoblaze
      VHDL source folder
    - A portion of the design uses a undocumented mode of operation for
      the S3E DCM. Instructions for enabling this can be found on page
      13 of the Frequency generator documentation. **The design will not
      work if the instructions are not followed!**
    - Afer this is done, you should be able to implement this design and
      program the FPGA with impact.
- Things you can do!
  - You can use the .ucf file to move around the pin assignments. For
    instance, you can have the frequency counter read the clock input
    off of a stake or one of the pmod headers.3
  - Easy extension - create a second ring oscillator, called ring_osc2.
    You can extend the ring_osc.vhd for this purpose, adding additional
    delay stages will decrease the frequency generated. Follow a similar
    format, to the rest of the VHDL code, to declare the component,
    instantiation, a second ring_oscillator signal, and modify the
    multiplexer.
    - Once that is done, synthesis, P&R, and program the design. Select
      the second ring oscillator and see what its frequency is!
  - Look at the PDF's which come with the reference designs for more
    ideas!
