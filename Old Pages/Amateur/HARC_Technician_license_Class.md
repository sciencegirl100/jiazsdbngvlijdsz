### About the class

Add another tool to your Maker toolkit: an Amateur Radio License.
Amateur Radio Operators (Hams) have a long history of "Homebrewing":
building their own equipment and experimenting in the hopes of making it
work better, and the community has grown a tremendous breadth. There is
tremendous overlap between the Ham and the Maker communities.

HacDC has it's own club license: W3HAC, which we originally obtained to
use ham radio for position tracking during our balloon flights using
APRS (Automatic Packet Reporting System) on VHF and UHF frequencies;
designing and building our own lightweight transmitter for the balloon
payload. We have many Hams here, some with quite advanced licenses, and
a bi-monthly meeting to discuss technical aspects of radio-based
communication and build stuff.
