When something goes wrong, its nice to note it here. Also nice to note
any fixes (eg. resurfacing the milling platform).

Maximum X-Axis feed rate of 60in/min was moderately error prone,
occasionally triggering emergency stop. Reduced to 40in/min, identical
to Y-Axis setting. [mirage335 2013-05-02](User:mirage335 "wikilink")

Settings on Mach3 were incorrect; communication with the mill controller
was impossible. The following settings changes were made (and some
fiddling done) and the mill appears to be functioning and calibrated
well:

- Changing the port to address 0x378 allowed the spindle control to
  function.
- Changing X,Y,Z,A drive and step ports to port 1 (0x378) and setting
  low trigger on axis X.
- Recalibrated "steps per" with the calibration wizard under *settings*
  using dial indicator (now set for ~16250).

Note: Often restarting Mach3 seems to be required to actually update
some of the port settings (although it pretends otherwise). Mill
calibration was accurate to only ~0.003" (which maybe a limit imposed by
the limited rigidity of the mill+stand).

- Major upgrades in progress thanks to TJ.

## 10 July 2012

- Platform still needs replacing, but Barlow resurfaced the remaining
  usable area. At least now it is level again.

## 28 Apr. 2012

- Someone accidentally resurfaced the milling platform (milled too
  deep). Now the platform needs replacing.

## 11 Apr. 2012

- Milling platform is no longer level, thanks to the screws holding it
  down being loosened up. Needs resurfacing.
