I've used eMachineshop to cut 200 plastic bases I needed for a project.
Pretty happy with the results and pricing. I used their (proprietary)
CAD tool which then can price an order and place an order.

Here's a company that specializes in low quantity runs and prototypes. I
don't know too much about them, but it seems like that fast quote system
might be nice.
