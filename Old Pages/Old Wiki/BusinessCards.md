We approved the purchase of business cards for the HacDC board and TimS
bought some LivingSocial/Groupon discounts for VistaPrint to print them.
Here are the Inkscape design files: ![Front](TMScard_SB.svg "Front") and
![Back](TMScard_Back_CC.svg "Back").

The coupons actually do help on the price but not as much as one might
think because larger percentage discounts are available without them.
Net cost was about \$17 for 250 glossy two-sided color cards or 500
matte cards.

The QR code was generated by <http://zxing.appspot.com/generator> which
I found gave a smaller payload than <http://www.qrstuff.com/>.
