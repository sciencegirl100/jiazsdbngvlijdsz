# Proposal

This project was originally thought up by JD/Jason (sorry I don't know
your full name). The general idea would be we would pick one item a week
to disassemble, and we would document each step with a text description
and photographs.

## Proposal Vitals

**Status**: In Progress, Discussion

- Project Lead: Derek Cooper
- Proposed Budget: \$ Unknown but enough to cover a domain name and
  hosting
- Goals:
  - To document hardware with text, photographs and possibly video.

## Background

From JD/Jason's original email to HacDC Blabber:

> After last night's disassembly spree, and reading the "hear the code"
> blog bits, I was thinking it would be interesting to start a "take it
> apart" column. The general idea would be we would pick one item a week
> to disassemble, and we would document each step with a text
> description and photographs. ("First we removed these screws, then we
> found these parts" etc) We will go as in depth as possible with the
> resources and time we have, possibly dumping ROMs (if applicable) and
> linking to processors involved. Ideally we will be able to reassemble
> whatever we've taken apart using the documentation we've produced, but
> that may or may not be applicable depending on the item and how it was
> originally made. As we progressed, we could either produce blog
> entries for the main HacDC page, or possibly in the wiki somewhere.

On January 24, 2009 I (Derek Cooper) discussed this project with Gareth
Branwyn. Gareth is a member of HacDC and is the online editor of Make
Magazine. He strongly encouraged us to move forward on this and offered
to publicize the project.

## Considerations

- We need volunteers.
- Need to setup a mailing list. I'll need to figure out how to do this.
- I'd like to launch a dedicated domain and website so we can encourage
  people outside HacDC to contribute.
- If we launch a dedicated website we'd need to come up with a domain
  name. Please add to this list:
  - Unmakery.org (or some other play on un-make)
  - hackwaredb.org
- I need to find a camera. Hopefully we at least have a still camera
  somewhere in the workspace.
- Ben built a lightbox which is currently stored on the shelves. I'd
  like to connect it, or another lightbox, permanently to the computer.
  I'd also like to keep it in a more convenient place.
