## Windows

You can download python from [Python 2.7
release](http://python.org/download/releases/2.7.1/), get the Windows
installer and run it.

After that, you are ready to install pygame, which can be obtained from
[Pygame releases for Windows](http://www3.telus.net/len_l/pygame/), make
sure you get the one for 2.7. Once you run the installer you should be
good to go.

## Mac osx

**OS X 10.6.\* (Snow Leopard)** You already have python 2.6 installed.
You need only then to download the pygame installer at [Pygame
releases](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml), you will find the snow
leopard installer at the bottom of the OS X section.

**OS X 10.5 and below** Earlier versions are running an older version of
python, so you may want to install python
[2.6](http://python.org/download/releases/2.7.1/) or
[2.7](http://python.org/download/releases/2.7.1/) and follow that with
the appropriate pygame installer from [Pygame
releases](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml)

## Linux

If you are running a recent version of your distro, chances are you may
already have python 2.6 or 2.7 installed. If that is the case you can go
ahead and install pygame using your package manager (in the case of
ubuntu the package is python-pygame).
