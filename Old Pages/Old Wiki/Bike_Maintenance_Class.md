__notoc__ This is a 6 week series intended for all skill/knowledge
levels. Each class will have a hands on portion so bring your bike in,
stands will be provided. If you can't, don't worry, each class will have
relevant demo bikes and components on hand. Tools will be limited so
bring in your own if you have them.
