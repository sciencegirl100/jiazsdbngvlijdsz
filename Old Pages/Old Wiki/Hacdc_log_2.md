May 2, 2022 Space reopened. Small turnout, uneventful. Bobby took
outgone Line 6 amp (after a 2 year delay; speaker & SEM circuit boards
appear to be gone). May 30 New OS, POP! OS, installed on 3D printer
computer. Most bins sorted, loose driver bits put in bottles except for
hex bits - the bottle intended for those was found to still contain
pills! Tabletop computers checked: 5VVYKH1 wasn't working, CPV3HF1 is
missing the USB drive with the OS, & 7KDNKH1 (after it was found in an
inaccessible corner) seemed to be fully updated! The other 4 are missing
(anyone know where they are?). June 11 ("Spring Cleaning") Had trouble
getting door unlocked. Found some stuff to consider getting rid of
(i.e., CRISPR material). Took 2 Spaceblimp bins down to basement. Looked
at basement - found radon monitor (Corentium) & metal saw (both Bobby's)
seem to be missing (anyone know where they are?). June 13 Updated some
signage. Attempt to replace incorrect CAD file on wiki crashed server.
Verified 7KDNKH1 did not need updating. Created this wiki entry since
trying to update the original log entry crashed the server (note
pattern). July 12 Space open for monthly meeting since Kevin was working
on 3D printer computer. Window above ham station was ajar at top. Carbon
dioxide meter read 650 ppm with only 2 people in space. Renderadmin
computer working; was able to make .stl file from .escad file.
