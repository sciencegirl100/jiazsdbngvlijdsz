## Description

The process taken to make a Hackerspace Passport of similar quality to a
US passport.

## Status

Received parts (paper and cover material)

## Plan

Use paper and cover material similar to US passport to make Hackerspace
Passports

1.  order fancy paper and vinyl cover material (done)
    - ordered 100% cotton paper and [vinyl report
      covers](http://www.factory-express.com/Supplies/BindingSupplies/BindingCovers/bindingcovers.html)
2.  make wood/plastic block stamps to print the generic info and layouts
    - planning to use the CNC to route the SVGs to wood blocks or PCB
      blanks
3.  make/order inks for printing
    - depends on the printing blocks
4.  print a test run on regular printer paper
    - the cotton paper is cheaper than gold but more expensive than
      plain printer paper by a lot
5.  print a Hackerspace Passport
    - pages only here
6.  figure out that whole embossing thing
    - pressing down the vinyl til it satays that way i get but the
      application of the metal leaf in conjunction is outside my realm
      of experience
7.  emboss cover art
    - insert magic here
8.  bind a Hackerspace Passport
    - my US passport is bound with some fancy string. i think i'll use
      telcom twisted pairs for mine :P
9.  enjoy perplexed look on TSA officers face when they search my bag at
    <insert major transit point here>
    - "WTF?" is such a satisfying expression to see :P
