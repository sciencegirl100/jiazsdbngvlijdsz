# Proposal

With the recent *-redacted for privacy review-*
[donation](donation "wikilink"), it's obvious that HacDC is now the
recipient of some unusual, historical, and unique items. To honor Mr.
*-redacted-*'s memory and preserve the unique nature of his gift, I
propose to create The HacDC Museum of Technology, and within the museum
the *-redacted-* Collection of Telephony, curated by HacDC membership.

Because of space concerns, I envision a locked storage box to collect
artifacts suitable for the museum that are off-limit for use in
projects, but available for examination and research by the membership.
Because a storage box is not precisely the ideal for a burgeoning
museum, items will be photographed, videod, catalogued, and available to
the general public via a website or wiki.

As an organization, HacDC has designated several areas of concentration.
The museum will fulfill several of the specific purposes of the
[Bylaws](Bylaws "wikilink"), including:

- Collaborate on all forms of technology, culture and craft in new and
  interesting ways.
- Apply the results of its work to specific cultural, charitable and
  scientific causes.
- Freely share its research and discoveries, using what is learned to
  teach others.

Initial items for the collection include:

- Lineman's handsets
- Blue Box
- AT&T Reference Manuals
- Historical Books
- Korean War Era Military Field Phone (working condition, sound great
  over 1000' of wire)
- Slide Rules

# History

[Ben Stanfield](User:Ben "wikilink") proposed this project.
As this project required specific earmarking of present HacDC resources
subject to the discretion of its participants, it required membership
approval.
This project was approved at the June 17, 2008 member meeting.
