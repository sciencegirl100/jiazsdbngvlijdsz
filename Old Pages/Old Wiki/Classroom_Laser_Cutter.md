# Goals

World peace. Also:

- A laser cutting device.
- A 3D Printer.
- A pick and place and solder paste and laser soldering machine.
- PCB fab through resist application, laser resist removal, and etchant
  application.
- Air flow controls
  - forcing air down (cooling a 3d print)
  - pulling air across and out (laser cutting)

# Tools

In order of priority.

- Laser(s?). For cutting.
- A single plastic extruder, for 3d printing.
- A part lifting nozzle, for pick and place functionality. --
