# Assumptions

- There is at least one mesh node.
- Meshes are not built through collusion, i.e., each person setting up a
  node does not do so knowing that others are as well.
- Mesh nodes are able to broadcast the existence of services they run
  ("I run a microblog!")
- Services can be activated on a node (implying that their presence will
  be announced) or deactivated (implying that their presence will not be
  announced)
- Mesh nodes continually listen for announcements of services from
  neighboring mesh nodeds
- Mesh nodes maintain directories of services running on neighboring
  mesh nodes
  - ...except when a service is designed to automatically federate with
    others of a like type (i.e., announcements of content from one will
    automatically be incorporated into cached announcements on the node)
- Clients neither broadcast nor listen for service announcements
  - Smartphones
  - MP3 players
  - Computers not running Byzantium

# Existing protocols

- Avahi/ZeroConf/mDNS
- Included in Porteus Linux
  - Host can publish running services
  - Host can be informed of services running on other hosts
  - User does not have to specifically configure any of this
  - Host admins may have to configure this
  - Bindings for multiple languages are available
  - Protocol in a nutshell:
    - Ad-hoc DHS over IP multicast (224.0.0.251, port 5353/UDP)
    - Each node has a resource record for each service
      - SRV
      - TXT
      - PTR
      - Types documented in /usr/share/avahi/service-types on
        Windbringer. File is part of Avahi on all systems.
        - HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH dnsmasq!
  - Resolution is done by the host running an Avahi implementation -
    broadcast a resolution request to the multicast domain and listen
    for a response
  - Node needs to have its hostname set (machinename.local)
  - Ignores point-to-point links by default. Add
    "allow-point-to-point=yes" in avahi-daemon.conf
    - Do mesh interfaces have the POINTTOPOINT flag?
  - wide-area functionality seems relevant to a mesh.
  - deny-interfaces=eth0 in avahi-daemon.conf may be necessary to
    prevent mDNS traffic from going over gateways.
  - avahi-daemon implements service announcement and listening, and
    interfaces with Avahi-enabled client apps.
  - avahi-dnsconfd connects to avahi-daemon and keeps track of unicast
    DNSes detected.
  - Read manage for avahi-daemon.conf!
  - Will need an /etc/avahi/services/foo.service XML file for each
    service offered by a node.
    - Manpage avahi.service(5) documents all required XML tags.
  - Each mesh node will have a list of all mesh nodes it's heard from in
    recent memory. This can be used to build the directory of
    neighboring services.

- XMPP service discovery
  - Message oriented, based on XML
  - Jabber's protocol.
  - [XEP-0030](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0030.html)
  - Used for discovering other XMPP entities/services implemented by
    XMPP servers.
    - Could be used for discovering and federating apps running on other
      nodes (i.e., distributed microblog).

# Notes

- KDE comes with something called Personal File Server, which allows
  arbitrary directories to be made available over HTTP(S?). It's
  Avahi-enabled. KDE is packagedwith Porteus. There's our file dump.
- avahi-bookmarks allows the user to access HTTP resources with a web
  browser.
- nss-mdns should be enabled in /etc/nssswitch.conf.
