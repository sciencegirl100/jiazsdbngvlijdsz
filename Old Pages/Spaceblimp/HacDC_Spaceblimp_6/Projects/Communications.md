# About

The communications project will deliver a balloon payload that allows
receipt of [telemetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry) and
other payload data as well allow command of the balloon systems as
needed. Communications are commonly delivered over [Amateur
Radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio) frequencies by
licensed operators. Networks like
[APRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Packet_Reporting_System)
are favored for some balloon-related communication.

These team members will also be responsible for ensuring one or more
suitable ground stations are in place to reliably receive data from the
communications systems. This team is encouraged to partner with the
[HacDC Amateur Radio club](http://www.w3hac.org) and [other amateur
radio organizations](http://www.arrl.org/find-a-club) and enthusiasts.
This team will also facilitate logistical communications primarily for
the launch and recovery teams.

# Team Members

- Derk
- [Ethan Waldo](User:Ewaldo "wikilink") (licensed for Amateur Radio)
- Martin (licensed for Amateur Radio)
- Nancy Wolfson

# Possible Balloon Communications

- Primary VHF APRS tracker - sends regular APRS beacons with GPS and
  limited telemetry - use national 144.390 MHz network
- Secondary UHF APRS tracker - sends regular APRS beacons with GPS and
  limited telemetry - use a frequency to be determined at the launch
  site
- 13 cm Broadband Downlink - send realtime video or broadband data
- uhf/vhf cross-band repeater - allow hams to communicate long distance
  with handy-talkies
- 433 MHz ISM band low data rate telemetry

# Possible Chase Team Communications

- Cell phone WiFi for APRS.fi information
- VHF and UHF APRS receiver, possibly tracking, text and digitpeating
  for off-grid operations
- Primary Voice - cell phone
- Secondary Voice - VHF and UHF mobile radios in conjunction with
  repeaters for off-grid operations operations

# Possible Ground Station Communications

- 13 cm broadband receiver/recorder with 90 cm dish
- UHF/VHF receiver/recorder for SSTV
- 433 MHz data receiver/recorder with yagi
- Primary Voice - cell phone
- Secondary Voice - VHF and UHF mobile radios in conjunction with
  repeaters for off-grid operations operations
