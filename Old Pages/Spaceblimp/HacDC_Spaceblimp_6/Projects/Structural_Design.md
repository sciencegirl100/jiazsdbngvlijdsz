# About

This team will provide guidance and deliver solutions for the structural
design of the payload bay, its securing to the balloon, and the balloon
itself. This team and all other project teams that will be delivering
payloads are expected to communicate needs, constraints, and
expectations. Final constraints and designs will be approved by the
Spaceblimp group at large.
