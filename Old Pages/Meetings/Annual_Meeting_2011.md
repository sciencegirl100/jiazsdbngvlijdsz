# Officer Reports

## President's Report

IRS 501c3 status has been obtained. Donations made to HacDC can now be
considered tax-exempt. Please contact any Board Member to obtain a
receipt for a donation made to the space.

Membership has changed over the past year; gaining members, losing
members and having old members return to the space.

Fundraising is now a very important part of our organization. This is
traditionally the job of the president in a non profit.

We have been in contact over the past two years with news
organizations - we need to make sure we keep in contact with these
groups, as it will only be beneficial for ourselves.

Keep up the programming! With our do-ocracy approach that may seem
difficult, but it is a crux of how we operate. See examples of Elliots
microcontrollers class, Brad's lockpicking class, Tom's lathe class, et
cetera. This is a core strength and needs to be maintained.

Remember that we're all adults and should be capable of resolving
personel issues amongst ourselves.

Always feel comfortable approaching the Board of Directors with any
issues you feel are large enough to warrant our attention. Email bod \[
at \] hacdc \[ dot \] org or talk to one of us in person. We need to be
aware of large issues.

We have some serious budget considerations we need to address. We have
an operating budget of about ~2,600 USD/month.

At the present burn rate, we will be able to make it through our current
lease without going bankrupt. After the end of our current lease, we
will need to seriously consider if we can stay in this space.

the change in our monthly rent? A: The church has started billing us at
the proper rate, as of this month.

# Member Reports

- Martin: Robotfest is coming up. This is a huge gathering of folks
  likeminded towards HacDC. We should make a presence there, as it will
  provide good visibility to us as an organization. We should take up
  spaceblimp, other projects we do. I volunteer to drive up there.

<!-- -->

- Todd Fine: Nick B. and Alex H. helped out quite a bit in building out
  the FIRST Robotics robot. This is a good start towards a useful
  relationship to promote HacDC.

# New Business

Brian: New benefits that go inhand with out 501c3 Status.

- Signed up for Google Ads for Hacdc, we get 10,000 USD worth of Adwords
  each month.
- Eventbrite fees are nearly nothing. Very easy to use to run ticketing
  for events that have limited resources. See Brian or ??? to get hooked
  up with that.

<!-- -->

- Remote meetings/telemeetings via GoToMeeting via TechSoup. \$95/year
  for up to 1000 attendees \[for up to 5 years, normally a 5,000 USD
  value\]. Voting allowed, but not secret ballot (if you want it secret,
  show up). Would also allow for remote attendees of classes. This
  allows for unlimited phone callins to classes, meetings, et cetera.
  Also screencasting. This nearly nonexistent in the Hackerspace world.
  IRC lurkers, members that are away from the space, other visitors, can
  easily callin or connect to our screencasts.
  - Redbeard proposed the purchase of GoToMeeting via TechSoup, TC
    Seconded.
  - Motion Passes

<!-- -->

- Brian Harrington proposes to ratify the standing rules as they stand.
  - Elliot Williams seconds the motion.

# Finances

Several ideas

- Artisphere electronics: Alberto has made us aware of Artisphere's
  desire to partner with us on an electronics class. There is potential
  to do a one off workshop. There a potential to run a longer-term class
  (8 weeks) that could be a revenue stream for us.
- Kickstarter: Valid for 501c3 donations, but cannot be used for
  operational expenses. Martin would like to see us put together a
  Kickstarter program put in place in order to build up facilities.
- JustMike - Lots of potential to get federal funding for wireless
  sensor networks, solar power, methane works. Needs to be applied to
  green energy, agriculture, energy reduction applications. Kid/youth
  education and integration programs are also available.
- Peter Edworthy - We need to make sure anything we do has some way to
  enable longterm financial streams.
- Toast: RadioCPR does bar nights, CPR does 1200/USD pre bar night in
  practically free money. We should too.
