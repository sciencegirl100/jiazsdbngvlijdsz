## Junk Bins (Proposed)

- Level 1 - aka "1 week bin"
  - When an item(s) is placed in the Level 1 bin, it (or its container)
    must be **NONDESTRUCTIVELY AND NONPERMANENTLY** labeled with the
    date it was removed from the bench and from which bench it was
    removed. [see map](Space_Map "wikilink")
  - After 1 week in a Level 1 bin an item must be placed in a Level 2
    junk bin.
- Level 2 - aka "1 month bin"
  - After 1 month in a Level 2 bin an item should be placed in a Level 3
    bin
- Level 3 - aka "removal bin"
  - When an item is placed in a Level 3 bin it should be photographed
    and posted to the <yet to be defined junk repo> with a brief textual
    description.
  - Labeled (as described in previous Junk Bin Levels) items in Level 3
    bins may \*not\* be remain in the space once their time has elapsed.
  - After a month in a Level 3 bin items will be recycled, trashed,
    stripped for parts, sold by HacDC, or otherwise disposed of as the
    Junk Comity or Voting Membership sees fit.
