At the moment this is Katie's page for planning an LED Embroidery
workshop. It may later become a resource page for workshop participants.

[LED Calculator](http://led.linear1.org/1led.wiz)

[one way to do
it](http://makeprojects.com/Project/Electronic-Embroidery/44/1)

Resources already on hand:

- coin cell batteries (3V)
- ~~resistors~~ [not
  needed](http://www.evilmadscientist.com/article.php/throw/print) in
  this case
  - Limor says lithium coin batteries are internally current-limited
- conductive thread (~25Ohms/foot)
- white 3mm LEDs (3.5V, 20mA)

What each participant should get:

1.  embroidery needle
2.  regular embroidery thread
3.  conductive thread
4.  LEDs
5.  embroidery hoop
6.  dark fabric
7.  fabric pencil?
8.  coin cell battery
9.  tape to secure battery?
10. needle threader

Resource I should provide:

1.  books with constellation drawings
2.  photo and sample of finished piece

Instructions:

1.  Choose a design.
2.  Layout the design with fabric pencil.
3.  Prep LEDs (punch through fabric and twist leads).
4.  Sew circuit with conductive thread.
5.  Test with battery.
6.  Sew decorative part with regular thread.
