What a long, strange trip it's been!

[aprs.fi Flight
Map](http://aprs.fi/?call=w3hac-11&dt=1281139200&mt=roadmap&z=11&timerange=3600),
which shows our telemetry just up until the antenna broke (and the GPS
conked out). It was lost in a tree for three months within a mile of
where we though it was due to land. (At least our predictions are good.)

And the [photos](http://ofdc.org/sb/) made it out just fine. Hooray!
