Our general communications policy is simple:

1.  Pick a system that works to facilitate communication
2.  Use it
3.  Don't change it unless it's failing.

## E-Mail

E-mail is the most common method of communication within HacDC and
between HacDC and the outside world.

### Public E-mail Lists

Our public lists, which anyone can sign up for, are:

- [announce@hacdc.org](http://hacdc.org/mailman/listinfo/announce_hacdc.org)
  : A moderated, weekly update list designed to keep the general public
  informed about what's happening, what's been discussed and what's
  coming up at HacDC.
- [blabber@hacdc.org](http://hacdc.org/mailman/listinfo/blabber_hacdc.org)
  : Our completely unmoderated and public open discussion forum covering
  a wide range of topics and questions.

### Public POC E-mail

All inquiries from the outside world, via e-mail, should go to
[bod@hacdc.org](bod@hacdc.org "wikilink").

[bod@hacdc.org](bod@hacdc.org "wikilink") may be used within the web
page, wiki, on documents, flyers, etc. as a way for those outside HacDC
to contact the organization.

### Internal/Member E-mail Addresses/Aliases

Each member is entitled to an @hacdc.org e-mail account. HacDC shall
offer hosting for @hacdc.org e-mail accounts or offer the option of
forwarding to the member's chosen e-mail address. Member e-mail shall
not be archived, except as chosen by the member in a hosted e-mail
account.

### Project Contact E-Mail Addresses

Each ongoing project must have an e-mail address associated with it. The
e-mail address may be an alias for the project coordinator, a discussion
list for the project as a whole or an alias to bod@ so [The
Ministers](The_Ministers "wikilink") may be able to send project
inquiries to the correct relevant parties. In any case, the status of
each project contact e-mail must be documented here:
