## Phil's Notes

**Imagined Stakeholder Persona**

Role: \[STEAM\] Funder / Donor

Name: \[Thurston Howell III\] Age: 50 Occupation: Corporate Philanthropy
Director \[Do they exist?\] Type: Would-have-been screenwriter or
sculptor.

Characteristics: Driven highly-capable professional Potential Ivy League
or similar background \[specified in discussion: Stanford\] Inured to
corporate ecosystem. \[Major? Career path? Not specified in my write-up,
underspecified in discussion; one could (stretching it) imagine a
quantitative analyst who began as a physicist and moved to Wall Street
e.g. but that is a relatively narrow path that doesn???t seem consistent
with the interests specified in ???type??? above. THIS PART OF THE
PORTRAIT NEEDS WORK.\]

Goals: Make corporation look / do good. Build a portfolio of
high-prestige / high-interest-value (press-ready) projects funded Wants
to see results in real world.

Motivations: Make corporation look / do good Help others excel in
careers he had no time for

Barriers: Must justify decisions to higher-up boards \[,
public-relations professionals, etc.\] Must satisfy high-prestige /
high-status parties he consults with / in his social network Trusted
contacts not omniscient: HacDC???s visibility buffered / mediated by
established authorities & patterns of thought, patterns of media
coverage \[Discussion: - is a hackerspace a shady / disreputable /
potentially criminal organization in the way ???hackers??? are portrayed
in the press? - is a hackerspace established in some way culturally,
popularly felt to be a meritorious site of activity? - \[Abstracting
from some discussion: is a hackerspace just a club for geeks? Do they
deliver a product in the form of invention? Do they educate? Are they
helping kids to learn? A hackerspace is educational? So do they fill an
educational niche not better or sufficiently filled by traditional or
charter schools & school activities?\] - \[Thinking further: is a
hackerspace a site of creative use of technology, as in supporting arts?
I???m thinking of Nam June Paik and Ai Weiwei and artists like that;
would a hackerspace enable such a person to develop or to develop and
bring out their works? No way. Tell me more . . . \]

Trusted Sources: Professional nonprofit BOD / Executive directors Art &
literary critics Leaders in academia \[Added after: Contacts he
cultivates in the press to see what is hot & new / in effect, proxy
???coolhunters??? enabling to see out towards technical and cultural
horizon\] Publications / Press: \[The unifying principle of these
notional selections is a very broad net cast in the open media,
professional and gray literature, etc. scoured as time allows for leads
on emerging fields for the creative use or teaching of technology; our
idealized / imagined philanthropy director samples these media partly to
escape boredom and repetition with habitual paths of cultural
investment, but relies on them also to fact-check and assess the success
potential, prestige potential, and a fuzzy idea called ???merit??? for
his corporation???s funded projects.\]
