### Procedures

### Donations

If you would like to donate items to HacDC please email bod@hacdc.org
and we can help you decide what to donate and if needed where things
that we can't take can go. When the donation arrives at the space each
item should be labeled with a date of arrival and put where it belongs.
A member can help you find where that is.

#### Give Aways

If you would like to just give away free stuff please label each item
with the date it entered HacDC and that it is a "Give Away" so we can
dispose of them if no one wants them after a (currently unspecified)
amount of time.
