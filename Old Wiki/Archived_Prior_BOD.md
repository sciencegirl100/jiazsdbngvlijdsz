## The [Board of Directors](Board_of_Directors "wikilink") (Set by Bylaws)

The [Board of Directors](Board_of_Directors "wikilink"), per our
[Bylaws](Bylaws "wikilink") consists of [the
Ministers](the_Ministers "wikilink") and two At-Large Directors. The
[Board of Directors](Board_of_Directors "wikilink") at HacDC is largely
ceremonial. Members generally directly decide on all issues before
HacDC. Only certain minutiae and other actions required by law are
carried out by the [Board of Directors](Board_of_Directors "wikilink").

Despite direct membership control wherever possible, the [Board of
Directors](Board_of_Directors "wikilink") remains primarily responsible
for the affairs of HacDC under District of Columbia Corporate Law.

### [The Ministers](The_Ministers "wikilink")

Most corporate law refers to "officers". [The
Ministers](The_Ministers "wikilink") are our Corporate Officers and
serve in the following roles:

- [Coordinator in Chief](Coordinator_in_Chief "wikilink") = President
  and Chairman of the [Board of
  Directors](Board_of_Directors "wikilink")
- [Minister of Information](Minister_of_Information "wikilink") =
  Executive Vice President and Vice Chairman of the [Board of
  Directors](Board_of_Directors "wikilink") (and Chief Information
  Officer)
- [Keeper of the MIBS](Keeper_of_the_MIBS "wikilink") = Secretary
- [Minister of Finance](Minister_of_Finance "wikilink") = Treasurer

### At Large Directors

The At Large Directors are the membership's direct representation on the
[Board of Directors](Board_of_Directors "wikilink"). At Large Directors
should be regular members who are not involved with the day-to-day
running of HacDC. They are there to offer advice and perspective to [the
Ministers](the_Ministers "wikilink") and act as a form of internal
control.
