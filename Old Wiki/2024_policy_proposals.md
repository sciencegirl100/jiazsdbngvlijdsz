## Noisebridge Inspirations

Suggested by Callie Composed by Gabriel

Noisebridge has a lot of good material on their wiki about community
standards. We have an [Anti-Harassment
Policy](Anti-Harassment_Policy "wikilink"), but we could have a lot more
clarity around expected conduct at the space. Here are some policies I'd
like to highlight for consideration at HacDC,

- ([Conflict
  Resolution](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Conflict_Resolution))

1.  Start by being
    [Excellent](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Excellence) to each
    other
2.  Try to resolve potential conflicts that arise using [Restorative
    Communication](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Restorative_Communication)
3.  [Ask To
    Disengage](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Ask_To_Disengage) to
    separate people in an argument that is escalating.
4.  [Ask to leave](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/AskToLeave) if
    someone refuses to disengage or is doing something that makes people
    feel unsafe.
5.  [Ask for Mediation](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Mediation) if
    you don't seem to be able to resolve issues with someone in the
    space directly.

- ([No_sleeping_at_Noisebridge](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/No_sleeping_at_Noisebridge))
  You can hack at HacDC as late as you want, but you can not sleep here.

## Open Hac Nights

We have a popular open hac night on Mondays. The official hours are from
7-9. I think we need to make it clear that hosts of this meeting are
free to ask visitors to leave at 9 if no other members are going to be
present. IF there are members who want to continue to host guests past 9
then it is their responsibility to supervise and clean up after those
guests.

## Permission Required on Recordings

Proposed/composed by: Callie

No one shall record media, or share media recorded, in our space, such
as includes images of someone else, or original ideas, sayings, or
products of labor made by someone else, unless such are agreed upon:

- scope of use or publication
- branding or labeling conditions, including the original producer's
  name
- a simple erasure procedure

## Non Aggression

Proposed by: Sven Composed by: Callie

In case anyone using our space engages in, or displays aggression in
body motions, language, or mannerisms, such one shall be compelled from
our space, so as remaining members can reclaim secure premises.
