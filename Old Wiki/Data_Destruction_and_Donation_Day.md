quality hardware for HacDC.

## Proposal Vitals

**Status**: In Progress, Discussion

- Project Lead: ?
- Proposed Budget: \$0
- Goals:
  - To obtain more quality hardware for HacDC
  - To teach the public/corporations about proper Data Destruction
    techniques
  - To build relationships with potential donors, future sources of
    hardware
  - To develop & demo creative ways of recycling computers

## Detailed Proposal

A lot of local companies and non-profits have old computers sitting
around. They know they need to destroy the data before the dispose of
the machines, but they can't afford a professional disposal service.

I thought it would be fun to have a public event where we would teach
people how to dismantle and destroy their hard-drives. We could pitch it
as a security event, capitalizing on the Hacker name in a positive way.
We could publicize the event by sending invitations to local companies,
perhaps through the chamber of commerce. I'd like to also invite local
non-profits but I don't know if there's an easy way to reach them.

My thought was that we could harvest the magnets and use them to build a
windmill generator. The only problem is that I've been too tired to
follow through. My current consulting arrangment ends on the first of
January. If I don't get another job or contract immediately I may have
time to work on this.
