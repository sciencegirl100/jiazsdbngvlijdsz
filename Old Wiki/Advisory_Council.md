The HacDC Advisory Council is an informal group of people who offer
advice to HacDC. The council presently offers advice via a closed,
invite-only e-mail list.

Members on the Advisory Council are typically those who can offer great
amounts of support to HacDC, through publicity and financial means, but
for time and distance reasons, cannot regularly participate in HacDC.
