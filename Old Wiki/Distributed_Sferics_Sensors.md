## Proposal

Very nebulous idea at the moment, but the idea would be to build a
distributed lightning detection system, with the intended goal of having
precision high enough to go find the aftereffects of strikes (like
[geocaching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocaching)). After thinking
of this, I found some dutch folks have done [much what I had in
mind](http://members.home.nl/fkooiman/lightning/), so the problem is
kind of a solved one. Still, it would be neat thing to make, and it
doesn't appear to have a stateside equivalent yet (its sort of a public
service project). [Here](http://www.blitzortung.org/) is live data
coming from the central European system.

I've heard the government runs these, but I haven't found any place the
data is accessible online. If that's the case (and it's fairly high res)
my enthusiasm for this idea is dimmed a lot.
