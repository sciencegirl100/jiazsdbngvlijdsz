This page serves as a specification and feature request page for the
classroom laptops.

The classroom laptops are running a Linux distribution, currently Debian
(probably better to be running testing than stable), with MATE desktop
environment. Tom maintains a canonical image.

They are used primarily for modeling, rendering, and slicing 3d printed
parts, but can and should be functional for all purposes in the
classroom.

Currently implemented on a bunch (6) of Dell D430s, maybe some D420s.

## Hardware

I (Tom) donated 6 old Dell Core Duo D430/420 laptops for this use.
They're super cheap and I had a pile of them. I think they're actually
kind of ideal for this purpose, all things considered. They're not nice
enough that anybody would want to re-purpose them to any other job, and
since most of them don't have batteries nobody walks off with them.
After almost a year they seem to be doing the job and getting lots of
use.

## Software (locally installed or remote access)

### 3d design

- Cura
- Meshlab
- Implicitcad (runs on Jobs or gygax)

### Browsers

- Firefox
- Chromium
- Midori or something similarly lightweight.

### Microcontroller

- INO
- Arduino

### Coding

- Python 3
- Rust

### Productivity

- Something for email
- Printing should be enabled

### Sys utils

- tmux ssh vi/vim emacs etc.
- Terminator
- guake
- most
- avahi-utils

### Other HacDC activities

Documentation, links, and how-tos on the desktop...

## TODO

- Update image and re-image all laptops.
- Enable all laptops for incoming and outgoing email...?
- Fix the HW clock issue possibly by setup NTP so that SSL errors don't
  happen.
- Work out a way to do efficient X-forwarding over our WiFi to job
  server for heavier applications.
- Configure laptops in some way to be more like a thin client so there
  is no/less need to 'update' the image or re-image regularly. In the
  dumbest case we could have them be simple VNC kiosks to a VM running
  on jobs...?
  - Test above last two for practicality.

## Feature requests

- Most recent Arduino suite. \[INO\]
- More scripts and or instructions for usability -- 2d printing, 3d
  printing, using jobs.
- Maybe put ~/\* or ~/Desktop on a network share.
