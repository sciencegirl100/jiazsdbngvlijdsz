## Multi-Touch Display Interface

The discussion list for this project is
[multi-touch-int-display@hacdc.org](http://hacdc.org/mailman/listinfo/multi-touch-int-display_hacdc.org).

### Meeting Minutes

- [Roadmap Meeting](MTID030708 "wikilink")

### Overview

Build the multi-touch display interface so that it can become a user
interface for future HacDC projects as well as provide a collaboration
interface for real-time multi-user-multi-touch applications, created by
and for HacDC and its friends.
