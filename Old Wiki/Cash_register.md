Our cash register is a Sharp XE-A203 ([quickstart
guide](:media:Cas_qguide_XEA203.pdf "wikilink"), [full
manual](:media:Cas_man_XEA203.pdf "wikilink")).

## How to Use the Cash Register

Before beginning, make sure that the key is set to the *Reg* position.
If you want a receipt, turn the key to the *OP X/2* position and hit the
<span style="color:salmon">**RCPT/PO**</span> key.

1.  Hit the <span style="color:salmon">**ESC**</span> key in the lower
    left-hand corner.
2.  If you're a HacDC member, hit the **1** key in the Amount/Clerk
    Keys. Otherwise—i.e., if you're a guest—hit the **2** key in the
    Amount/Clerk Keys.
3.  Hit the **CL** key in the Amount/Clerk Keys.
4.  Enter the amount of your purchase on the Amount/Clerk Keys. DO NOT
    USE THE DECIMAL KEY. For example, to enter 50 cents, press the **5**
    key then the **0** key on the Amount/Clerk Keys.
5.  Under Department Keys, hit the appropriate department key, according
    to the table below. If you have multiple items to ring up, repeat
    steps 4 and 5.
6.  Press the <span style="color:lightseagreen">**CA/AT/NS**</span> key
    in the bottom right-hand corner.
7.  Put in your money and close the drawer!
