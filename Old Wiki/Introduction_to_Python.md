So you???ve got this great new idea, but it requires a computer.. The
blasted thing just doesn???t do what you need it to do out of the box.
You???ve got a few options: you can give up on your project (I???m just
saying..), you can find a programmer to whisper sweet nothings to your
expensive doorstop (you may have to bribe them), or you can master the
art of pillow talk for your processor. Presumably, you???re interested
in the last option. While I can???t promise you that you???ll become the
Fabio of circuitry over-night, I can promise you???ll know how to
motivate that doorstop of yours if you attend my class. In a
less-than-formal environment, I plan to take you from not even having
python installed to understanding the fundamentals of programming. If
all goes well, you should be able to create fairly complicated programs,
understand (and know how to find) the python online documentation, and
have this irrational urge to learn more. For those with some background
in programming, we???ll be covering: variables, if-statements, looping,
fundamental data structures, functions, and modules. If that didn???t
make any sense, or you don???t already know how to do all that in
python, this is the class for you!
