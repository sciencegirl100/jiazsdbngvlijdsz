Planning meeting: Thu Mar 3 2011 after the bike maintenance class (done)
Planning meeting \#2: Wed Mar 16 2011 after the elements of computing
class (doneish)

**Sprint Date: Fri-Sun March 25-27**
[Inventory](Byzantium_Sprint_2_Inventory "wikilink")

### Schedule

FRI: 8:00pm Pizza, sprint 1 recap, and prep (mostly ripping thing apart
and some assembly) SAT:

- Noon Brunch and final assembly followed by bench tests and midrange
  tests depending on speed of success
- Dinner Time: Dinner outside the space. This must occur outside the
  space.
- 9:00pmish? Discussion and general planning for Sunday optionally
  followed by more testing/making

SUN:

- Noon Brunch prep for long distance tests followed by long distance
  tests
- Dinner Time: Dinner outside the space. This must occur outside the
  space.
- 9:00pmish? Discussion and planning for the next sprint

### Stuff to bring (proposed)

- FMRS/GMRS radios that you wouldn't mind hacking.
- Childrens' walkie-talkies. [User:Drwho](User:Drwho "wikilink") knows
  where to buy cheap pairs of them locally.
- Webcams *that are known to work with Linux*. That's closer to black
  magick than computer science, so do your homework first (or on your
  smartphone while at the store). The feature to look for is called
  [UVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_video_device_class) though
  webcam boxes still might not mention it.
- Laser pointers (the more exotic the colors the better). Buy them when
  you find them. When you go looking for them you can never find them.
- Really bright LEDs
- Photocells, photoresistors, photodetectors.
- Microcontrollers. They may come in handy for modulating/demodulating
  signals.
- Hackable wireless access points. Here are some
  [examples](http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&DEPA=0&Order=BESTMATCH&Description=dd+wrt)
  that might work.
- old headphones/headsets/stereo audio cables and phone cords for
  cutting up and making into modem to radio connectors

### Radio

- radio shack/hardware store high bandwidth unlicensed spectrum
- Hacked FRS/GMRS radios
  - [Text messages over
    walkie-talkies.](http://takethingsapart.blogspot.com/2010/07/note-before-constructing-device-such-as.html)
  - [Forum post with some
    ideas.](http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1270645507)
  - Pros:
    - cheap
    - longish range (35mi allegedly)
  - Cons:
    - Need an automated PTT switch or two radios per node
- Develop improvised antennae to improve signal quality, distance
  covered.
  - anything + aluminium foil = bouncy bouncy for radio waves

The FCC has designated a number of channels in the 27 MHz band that can
be used for signaling and radio control. They are unnumbered and
in-between CB channels 1-13

### Optical

- Modified Ronja-like
  - with lasers
  - with balloon targets
  - with lasers and balloon targets
  - with lasers and self-adhesive mirrored decals.
- All Electronics Magazine had a couple of articles on building
  lasercomm devices on the cheap. Somebody remind the Doctor to go
  through his magazine collection.
- [How to make a simple laser
  communicator.](http://www.make-digital.com/make/vol16/?pg=69#pg69) (I
  do have this issue. Have bought parts to build a pair of transceivers.
  --The Doctor)
- [Handbook of Optical Through-the-Air
  Communications](http://www.imagineeringezine.com/files/air-bk2.html)
  is a good read on the basics of an LED-based hardware setup, though
  he's aiming at voice comms. (Elliot)

### Inspiration

- [Ronja](Ronja "wikilink")

### Homework

- read up on [Ronja](http://ronja.twibright.com/)
- read up on FMRS/GMRS
- read up on and talk to the HacDC Spaceblimp team about soundcard
  modems: like [this](http://www.baycom.org/~tom/ham/soundmodem/) (also
  available via apt [like so](Notes_on_Soundmodem "wikilink"))
  - [Howto](http://www.linux-ax25.org/wiki/Soundmodem)(go here last it's
    a bit short on soundmodem specific info)
  - [Notes on Soundmodem](Notes_on_Soundmodem "wikilink")
  - [Soundmodem in the
    field.](http://www.qbjnet.com/packet.html#soundmodem)
- Read up on [AX.25](AX.25 "wikilink").

### Goals (proposed)

- Optimize for hackability. Could your average geek build a few of these
  using junk around zir house and deploy them in an emergency situation?
  - not a chance
- Determine the optimum speed in bits per second for a mesh-to-mesh
  link.
  - very crazy slow (we didn't bother measuring it was so slow)
- Measure the bandwidth of a point-to-point long haul connection at a
  particular distance.
  - again to slow to bother
- Determine the maximum practical distance for a long haul connection
  between two meshes in an urban environment.
  - didn't get that far
- Mathematically describe the way to maximize throughput with a minimum
  number of nodes.
  - didn't get that far
- Run an ssh session over whatever link is established.
  - done
- Interact with a web page over whatever link is established.
  - connection was too unstable to get this far
- Develop methods to minimize latency.
  - tweak the source and transmitter volume A LOT until the it's perfect
- Determine the efficiency of the mesh routing protocol we settle on.
  - didn't get this far
  - How many active nodes per mesh can be reasonably supported before
    connectivity breaks down?
    - to be determined

### Apps running on Windbringer (laptop/node) to prove functionality

- [status.net v0.9.6](http://status.net/open-source)
- [Mediawiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki)

### Lessons Learned

- "how hard can it be" ... oops :(
  - very. soundmodem is finicky and creates unstable connections 20%
    packet loss at best 80-90% avg.
  - Don't forget network latency of 35,500ms over a distance of eight
    feet.
- "What could possibly go wrong?" ... oops :(
  - everything
  - [There are no experimental failures. There is only more
    data.](http://drwho.virtadpt.net/archive/2011/04/14/project-byzantium-development-sprint-2)

Let's see how much of [Project FabFi](http://fabfi.fablab.af/) we can
make use of!
