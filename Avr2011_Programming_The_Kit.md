# Software:

If you haven't already installed the laptop-side software toolchain, see
[Installing AVR Toolchain](Installing_AVR_Toolchain "wikilink") and come
on back.

# Hookup:

- your laptop
- an FTDI cable
- the classboard, populated with chip and FTDI header

The chips we use in class are pre-flashed with a bootloader, which means
that you can program them over the AVR's serial port.

Plug the FTDI cable into the board -- black wire to GND.

# Getting the Board Into Bootloader Mode

When the chip starts up, the bootloader program checks if the "B" button
(connected to PD2) is pressed. If the button is pressed, it sits and
waits for programming data to come in over the serial line. If the
button isn't pressed, it starts your program. So, what you want to do is
reset the chip while the "B" button is pressed.

To get the chip into ready-to-program Bootloader Mode:

- Hold down the "B" button
- Tap the "A" button (RESET)
- Now you can release the "B" button

You can tell you're in bootloader mode because your normal code won't be
running. If you had and LED on or blinking, for instance, it won't be
now.

# Programming the Chip

- Get the chip into bootloader mode
- While you're in the directory with your code and the Makefile, type
  "make" or "sudo make" into the terminal
- Your code will compile, and it will upload your code to the chip
- The chip will automatically reset and start running your program

If all is well, you will see

    avrdude done.  Thank you.

# If there are errors...

Common problems and their solutions include:

- Permissions to write to USB port. Solution: keep typing "sudo make" or
  add yourself to the USB output group:
      Ubuntu: sudo usermod -a -G dialout yourNameHere

<!-- -->

- /dev/ttyUSB0 not found. Is the FTDI cable plugged in? Try "lsusb" to
  see if it's there. Try "ls /dev/ttyUSB\*" to see if it's registered as
  USB1. Edit Makefile accordingly, and remember that you'll probably
  have to change it back later.

<!-- -->

- Bugs in your code -\> failure to compile. If you get something like:
  `Compiling: LED_Demo.c`
  `LED_Demo.c: In function ???main???:`
  `LED_Demo.c:22: error: expected ???;??? before ???while???`
  `make: *** [LED_Demo.o] Error 1`
  you have an error in your code that's preventing compilation. Read the
  error output for hints, tweak your code, and try again. (In this case,
  I left out a ';' in line 20.)
