HacDC ran [HackersMart, The Hackers Convenience
Store](http://wiki.hope.net/index.php/HackersMart), during The Last
HOPE. Designed to be a "one stop shop" for things attendees might need
and might not be readily available (especially at night), it's a way to
raise money for HacDC and provide a service to conference goers. In the
future, Hackersmart will be traveling to other
[Conferences](Conferences "wikilink").

## Hackersmart Lessons Learned

### Preparation

- Make sure everyone knows how to operate the [cash
  register](cash_register "wikilink").
- When members are scheduling their travel to and from the event, have
  them take into account the time it will take to set up and tear down
  the Hackersmart, including hauling and loading boxes.
- Bring only labeled boxes. Keep things sorted as much as possible
  throughout the event. Confusion leads to lost sales.
- New customers are like razor-toothed gree worms. They can be
  succulent, but sometimes they bite back.

### Inventory

- Keep a notepad upon which to record requests. Every time someone asks
  for something you don't have, even if it seems like an item you'd
  never consider carrying, write it down. Future business ideas start
  here.
- Establish a dedicated separate spot for "employees" to leave their
  crap so it doesn't get mistaken for inventory. Especially on Sunday as
  people check out of their rooms, crap piles up.

### Pricing

- Price everything clearly, or mark "make-offer" items as such.
- Get someone familiar with each item to price it. If there's something
  unique about an otherwise mundane-looking item, that familiar person
  should write it down so that, if they're not available when a customer
  wants to haggle, those who *are* available don't unknowingly let it go
  too cheap.
- Giving things away can sometimes be much more profitable than selling
  them. Handing someone a pair of two-cent LEDs and saying "don't worry
  about it" usually got a few quarters or sometimes a whole dollar
  thrown in the tipjar.
