# About

The recovery team will be responsible for arriving at the [predicted
recovery site](HacDC_Spaceblimp_6/Projects/Flight_Prediction "wikilink")
to track and relocate (as best as possible when flight deviations occu)
in order to recover the balloon after its return. At least one [amateur
radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio) operator should be
present in the group. Communications with the [launch
team](HacDC_Spaceblimp_6/Projects/Launch_team "wikilink") should be
maintained as best as possible through preparations made by the
[communications
logistics](HacDC_Spaceblimp_6/Projects/Groundwork#Logistical_Communications "wikilink")
team.
