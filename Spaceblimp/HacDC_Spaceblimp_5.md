Spaceblimp-5 Launched: July 9, 2011

## Summary

This time we were going for altitude, and we got it! The max recorded
altitude was 118,533 ft! (Getting us the 16th highest altitude record on
[ARHAB.org](http://arhab.org/) !)

The launch site was: Strasburg VA, in a open area near the town on Rt
11, near the I-81. Lat: 38.9968 N Lon: 78.3508W

The path the balloon took was pretty strange, with the wind shifting
between ascent and descent, and so we had a lot more driving to do than
usual. The primary GPS/radio worked perfectly, and we got super-lucky
with the recovery, picking up the package ~15 minutes after it hit the
ground. The video camera overheated and failed before launch (booo!) and
we're still working on the instrument data, but all signs point to some
new and interesting results at the highest altitude we've ever run.

## Payload

### Radios

There were two radios on board the blimp that transmitted out the GPS
data:

- The primary radio was tied to the GPS and transmitted out to a network
  of amateur radio enthusiasts who then passed the location information
  on to get mapped here: [APRS.fi](http://aprs.fi/?call=W3HAC-11). We
  also ran some custom software that passes this data on to a Twitter
  account (once per minute!) which you could follow on your phone: [DC
  Spaceblimp Primary Twitter Feed](http://twitter.com/#!/DCSpaceblimp).
  (Click the link in the Twitter to pull up a map!)

<!-- -->

- The secondary radio was actually a GSM cell phone module, and
  broadcasted its data when in range of a cell tower. It broadcasted
  both GPS data for tracking, and a lot of the sensor data for science.
  It also twittered through [Society Of Robots Twitter
  Feed](http://twitter.com/#!/SocietyofRobotz).

### Cameras

The payload contains a couple cameras:

- a video camera (Canon Zi6)
- a still camera (Canon Powershot A-480) running custom firmware to get
  better exposures from space

### Instrumentation

and a lot of instrumentation:

- a geiger counter
- 9 degree-of-freedom IMU ([Inertial Measurement Unit on
  Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_measurement_unit))
- high-speed (50 sample/sec) accelerometer
- internal and external temperature sensors
- humidity sensor
- air pressure sensor
- IR and visible light sensors
- a solar panel, hooked up to measure the voltage
