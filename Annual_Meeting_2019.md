  would be interested in collaborating
- Board met with the owner of Exiles on U Street about the possibilities
  for fundraising - they are pretty flexible so there are many options
  to discuss

  something more tangible - there is a sign in sheet - all members and
  visitors should sign in.

### Vice President's Report

### Treasurer's Report

The cash flow spreadsheets should be visible to all present, and there
are a couple of things I would like to point out. We continue to have a
reserve of approximately \$10,000, though this is decreasing because we
are spending more money on rent per month than we are bringing in
through membership dues. The costs for January were unusually high so
look at those numbers with a grain of salt (we were charged for two
months rent during that period due to the timing of check cashing, and
we had additional one-time payments). The more important number for the
future is the \$1579/month rent that will continue to cost us in the
longer term.

We currently have 21 members in good standing. Due to irregular payment
schedules for some members this is not clear from the cash flow
spreadsheet but the majority of our members pay through Paypal. Dwolla
has recently closed down the service we were using for a handful of our
member payments so we are no longer able to collect dues through their
platform. We will need to modify the HacDC website to remove that
offering and possibly look into other alternatives that have lower fees
like Dwolla did (Paypal currently costs us about ~\$40/month in fees).

We have not seen any large effects due to fundraising, though we have
had a few individual donations that have helped us these last few
months. However both donations were from people within HacDC so I don't
think we are reaching a wider audience yet for our fundraising.

This is my last month as treasurer, I am resigning and not running again
for next year since I have not been living in the DC area for a few
months now. To whoever ends up in this board seat, I will reach out to
discuss the best way to hand off the credentials and any other pressing
financial matters for HacDC (e.g. filing with the IRS to maintain our
non-profit status).

## Audit Committee Report

Nobody bothered to form a committee so there's no report. All financial
statements including receipts for all purchases are at the space, in the
BOD locker, treasurer's folder. The Dwolla statements include member
names, the rest don't. -Enrique

## Member Reports

## Old Business

Rules of the Road - Code of Conduct Review

- Please review the draft code of conduct at
  <https://wiki.hacdc.org/index.php?title=Code_of_Conduct#DRAFT:_Code_of_Conduct_for_HacDC>
  for discussion at the next member meeting in April
- This has been updated with input from other members and review of
  codes of conduct of other hackerspaces

More space cleanup

- Need to finish cleaning out back section of basemen
- Mike Ritonia has agreed to install new lock on basement door
- We can use the dumpsters out front (within reason)
- Ideas for basement - besides storage, could we organize a workshop?
  Maybe metal or woodworking?

Proposal for an intermediate membership type:

- We have a discounted "starving hacker/student" and a keyed, full
  membership; unlike other spaces, we do not have an intermediate
  membership
- Typically, the intermediate membership level gives members limited
  storage, access to 'members wifi' (we would have to set that up) and a
  few other perks (could work unsupervised in the basement, for example)
- Do we see value in this dues level, and what are the membership
  services that come with it?

Discussion: need to develop ROI of membership levels, possibly create
new benefits. Important to know how many members at what level right
now. It would be good to have an effort at the April 23rd event to sign
up members or take donations.
