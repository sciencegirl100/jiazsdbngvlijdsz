We've had two rounds of the AVR Microcontroller class at HacDC so far.

- If you're looking to learn, see the 2011 class. [AVR Microcontroller
  Class 2011](AVR_Microcontroller_Class_2011 "wikilink") (happened in
  Feb/March 2011)

- If you're looking for specific old materials, we're keeping that
  online too! [AVR Microcontroller Class
  2009](AVR_Microcontroller_Class_2009 "wikilink") (the first run of the
  class)
