Goal - Reliably bridge two different and separate wireless networks
without using existing internet infrastructure.

Design goals 1) There should be a webserver on each network providing a
service of some kind (microblogs, web chat, file dump). 2) Nodes in
either network should be able to reach both webservers. 3) Nodes on one
network should be able to talk to nodes on the other network and vice
versa. 4) Networks should have at least 3-5 nodes each.

Tentative schedule is as follows:

Friday - 8:00pm Pizza and planning (any particular request should email
me off list). (COMPLETE!) Saturday - 9:00am Start showing up (IN
PROGRESS!) Saturday - 10:00am Divide into groups and start the sprint.
Sunday - 10:00am Start showing up. Sunday - 11:00am Finish the sprint!
Sunday - Evening Debriefing (I'll be taking extensive notes to update
the wiki).

Notes:

- [BATMAN](BATMAN "wikilink")
- [BATMAN-Advanced Setup](BATMAN-Advanced_Setup "wikilink")
- [Babel](Babel "wikilink")
- [Babel Setup](Babel_Setup "wikilink")

Plans! We're gonna have two teams each will implement a mesh network
using some existing mesh protocol. One team will be working with
BATMAN-Advanced and the other with BABEL. Each network will use at least
one openwrt device the rest will be laptops and netbooks.
