# About

These team members will deliver one or more payloads for tracking and
possibly integrating power-oriented subsystems. This will be critical
for understanding delivery of power to all payloads and may be used in
situ for reactionary measures as well as for post flight analysis. Some
common power subsystems can include battery, solar, energy harvesting,
and various generators with wind as a primary source.
