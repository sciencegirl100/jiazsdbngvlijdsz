This is a guide. While it is part of the [:Category:Communications
Policy](:Category:Communications_Policy "wikilink"), this is meant to
act as more of a guideline for how we communicate. Everyone can improve
their communication skills, which are vital not only to our work within
HacDC, but in our careers and relationships as well.
