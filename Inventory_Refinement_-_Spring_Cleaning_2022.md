Quorum met? No

This meeting was held as an addendum "refinement" meeting from the prior
Inventory by Bobby done in Feb 2020. Because the membership on premises
was limited due to pandemic, a full inventory wasn't held. Please
reference the following document for a more complete list:

Action items:

- Email Google Forms "keep/trash?" document to existing members with
  photos attached
- Add "for discussion" items to next Monthly Members Meeting
- Water Issues - basement:
  - coming in from outside
  - not draining inside, possible super-clog that appears that there
    isn't even a drain

    is opening with a tunnel (the tunnel is not part of our storage
    space, was offered to us at one point)

"laptops" without storage, without batteries and unlikely to have been
taken

safety goggles" sign

Radon detector (brand: Corintium) - missing Bobby's radon detector which
