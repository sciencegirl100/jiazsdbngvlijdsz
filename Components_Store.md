A sizable inventory of electronic components was purchased for
[Hackersmart](Hackersmart "wikilink"), with the goal that the unsold
portion thereof would seed HacDC's electronics lab. This has come to
pass, and the components are arranged on a pegboard by the soldering
desk. This page is to explain what's available, how much it cost, where
to get more, and as a place to request additions.

This list has not been actively maintained in some time. We are not able
to resell items or run a store because that would require us to collect
and pay DC sales tax. So, think of the parts as office supplies that we
have stocked. If you use something, please donate an appropriate amount
to the tip jar.

### Suppliers:

[Mouser](http://www.mouser.com) and [Digi-Key](http://www.digikey.com)
are the "big guns" of the hobbyist and small professional electronics
market, with breathtaking inventories, fast order fulfillment, and
sophisticated websites. Digi-Key adds a handling fee to orders under
\$25.

[Marlin P. Jones & Associates](http://www.mpja.com) is a smaller web
retailer specializing in power supplies, but with a fair assortment of
other stuff too. Their prices on breadboards are hard to beat. (Thanks
[Jon](http://serialwombat.com/) for that tip!)

[All Electronics](http://www.allelectronics.com/) has been in the
surplus electronics game for a long time, with a small newsprint catalog
that's a staple in many geeks' bathrooms. As with any surplus dealer,
their inventory is constantly in flux, and sometimes they have really
amazing deals.

[B.G. Micro](http://www.bgmicro.com/) (known pre-9/11 as "The
Electronics Mecca", now calls itself "The Electronics Supplier") is a
small mostly-surplus dealer whose bright yellow catalog offers Texas
humor mixed with eyestrain. Their shopping cart software is chaotic
evil, but they have great prices, particularly on industrial stuff like
thermal fuses and zener diodes.

[Electronics Goldmine](http://www.goldmine-elec-products.com/) has a
better selection of motors, magnets, and boxes than almost anyone else.
They offer "GoldPaks", grab-bags and assortments of surplus (sometimes
take-outs) hardware, some of which are so-so deals and some of which are
simply jawdropping.
