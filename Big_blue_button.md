## Introduction

Big Blue Button is an open source communication framework that allows
for video-conferencing and more. It would allow this hackerspace to host
video conferences for other hackerspaces/makerspaces and organizations
which would further enhance our ability to communicate and share
resources.

## Infrastructure

We will be using a high-cpu Digital Ocean droplet 8GB Ram/50GB SSD/4
CPUs. This was presented as a viable option by a very helpful Fred Dixon
from Blindside Networks.

We will use chill.hakely.org as our domain name until another
more-appropriate domain name is decided upon.
