## Description

Catch the first DNS request from a node or client and redirect them to a
page which will inform them of Byzantium's capabilities or lack thereof.

## Suggestions

- dnsmasq+custom scripts
  - Have DNSmasq running, config file generated by control panel.
  - Basic DNS hijacking possible (right now, intercepts www.google.com
    and encrypted.google.com)
  - When the captive portal is working we won't need to do this.
