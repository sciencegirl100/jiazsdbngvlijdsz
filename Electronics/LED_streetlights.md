# Efficiency

Interesting factoids about [replacing sodium vapor lamps with
LEDs](http://dansdata.blogsome.com/2008/12/27/led-street-lighting-not-as-good-as-you-think/)
for city-wide lighting.

- The theoretical lumen/Watt figures for LEDs are worse than
  low-pressure sodium vapor lamps (100 lm/W versus 200 lm/W)
- White LEDs are actually blue LEDs with a consumable phosphor layer
  that turns opaque after a few years of operation.
- Combined RGB LEDs will have better efficiency than a "white" LED.

Other real-world tests have concluded that LED street lights have about
the same lumen/Watt in practice as the sodium vapor lamps ([64 lm/W
LEDs](http://www.olino.org/us/articles/2008/11/02/streetlamp-lioris-aduro-52)
versus [67 lm/W Sodium
vapor](http://www.olino.org/us/articles/2008/12/29/indal-industria-aurora-streetlamp)).

Neon and florescent efficiency [depends on the color and
shape](http://www.signindustry.com/neon/articles/2003-07-11-RC-NeonandFlour.php3):

# Obstacles

Little Rock, AK wanted to replace their inefficient shielded lights with
more efficient fixtures, but their contract with Entergy is not a simple
\$/kW formula: [the energy company sets the price based on the type of
fixture](http://www.arktimes.com/Articles/ArticleViewer.aspx?ArticleID=fce07cab-0dea-4fc5-b57e-f1145715f01e).

> \[...\] According to Henry, the city tested out more efficient
> 100???watt HPS bulbs in one Little Rock neighborhood about five years
> ago. When the city asked Entergy to set a rate for those fixtures, it
> was almost double the rate for the 150-watt HPS type.
>
> When asked if Entergy was keeping Little Rock from being more energy
