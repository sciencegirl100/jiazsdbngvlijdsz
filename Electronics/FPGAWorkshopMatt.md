I've got a couple of ideas so far:

1.  WEP or WPA (or other hash/cipher) crack acceleration
    - In my dreams, I imagine a crack accelerator embedded in an
      autonomous robot that drives itself around cracking networks as it
      goes.
2.  non-von Neumann computer
    - E.g., the Reduceron, which is a machine that does something called
      graph reduction, a thing computationally equivalent to a Turing
      machine but which is better suited to pure functional languages
      like Haskell
    - see <http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/fp/reduceron/>
3.  SIP \<-\> analog telephone adapter
