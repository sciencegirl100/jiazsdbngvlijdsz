- We had about 20 folks and about 10 of whom were productively
  keysigning.

## Intro to KeySigning

- You have a private key and a public key, which you generate (your
  keypair).
  - gpg --gen-key

<!-- -->

- People use your public key to send you encrypted messages that only
  you can open via the magic of crypto!
  - gpg --output doc.gpg --encrypt --recipient obscurite@hacdc.org doc

<!-- -->

- You decrypt these messages with your private key, which only you have
  access to.
  - gpg --output doc --decrypt doc.gpg

<!-- -->

- But first, you must share your public key, either directly or by
  uploading it to a keyserver.
  - gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --send-keys D34DB33F

<!-- -->

- If it's on a keyserver, they must download it from the keyserver.
  - gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-key D34DB33F

<!-- -->

- If it was a file (called obscurite.gpg for example), they can import
  it manually.
  - gpg --import obscurite.gpg

<!-- -->

- Now they can sign the key and send the key back to the keyserver.
  - gpg --sign-key D34DB33F

<!-- -->

- But before anyone signs anyone elses key they have to make sure that
  person actually owns that key (checking physical ID).
  - Minimum recommendation is state photo ID + secondary photo ID
    (school, employer)

<!-- -->

- You can see who has signed someone's public key. If their key has been
  signed by someone in your web of trust, then that person is in your
  web of trust as well.
  - gpg --list-sigs D34DB33f

<!-- -->

- Don't forget to generate a revokation certificate for your public key
  in case you lose your passphrase or your key is compromised!
  - gpg --gen-revoke

## DETAILS

- Obscurite generally uses the pgp.mit.edu keyserver, but
  keyserver.ubuntu.com is well liked and they do sync regularly, so it
  doesn't especially matter which one you use, except that pgp.mit.edu
  has a nice web search interface.
- I will pass around copies of signatures so you can check people off as
  you confirm their identity
- I recommend using a valid state photo ID as a minimum validation. It
  is up to your personal "keysigning policy."
