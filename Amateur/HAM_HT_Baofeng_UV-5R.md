## Overview

The UV-5R family of radios are cheap 4W micro handheld transceivers with
reasonably good stock features especially given the price. They can be
modified to bypass the on board MCU, which is a write once chip that
cannot be modified. The UV-5Rs are software controlled radios (not SDRs)
they have hardware filters that prevent the same kinds of band expansion
as the UV-3Rs.

  open-source tool for programming your amateur radio. (appears to
  support the UV-5R)

## Notes

### Performance

#### MCM2013

- Receive sensitivity is pretty severely lacking. UV5R had issues at
  WaterPoint 4 on nets C/H/G. No received signal at all. All other HTs
  at the same location had perfectly fine Rx.

### Recommended Accessories

- A wide based flush fit BNC (or similarly durable connector) adapter
  (sometimes called an antenna saver) given the short mating cycle "SMA
  connectors are rated for up to 500 mating cycles" [citation via
  Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMA_connector)
  - example: [SMA Male to BNC Female
    Connector](http://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/m/mUgb7YRjFqInb9GoQZVkQMw/140.jpg)
  - Also you can replace the adapter much more easily than the SMA
    connection in the radio.
  - You can even apply some threadlock (the light duty stuff) to the
    threaded part and still keep the groundplane continuity because of
    the wide base on the adapter touching the rim of the SMA socket.
- Get a dedicated antenna for VHF and UHF (or whichever you will use the
  most). The dedicated antennas will do wonders for performance as the
  stock antenna is really pretty horrible and multiband antennas in
  general can only be so good on any given band they are tuned for
  before the others suffer, so they end up being okay at best on all of
  them. If you followed the above then get a BNC terminated antenna and
  don't worry about adapters for the antennas.

## Hardware Versions

There are a large number of internally identical radios with very
nonstandardized names in the UV-3R and UV-5R family.
