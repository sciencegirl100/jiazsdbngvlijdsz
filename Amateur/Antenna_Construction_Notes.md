- [2m dipole](http://www.hamuniverse.com/2mtrcheap.html) simple - Must
  be high above ground, no gain.

- [2m 1/4-wave monopole](http://www.hamuniverse.com/2metergp.html)
  simple - Note: It is ok to use 3 radials instead of 4, and they don't
  really need to slope downwards unless truly perfect SWR at 50Ohms is
  required. Sloping downwards will also reduce antenna gain.
