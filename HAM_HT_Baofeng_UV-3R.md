## Overview

The UV-3R family of radios are dirt cheap 2W handheld transceivers with
reasonably good stock features especially given the price. They can be
very easily modified to take advantage of the on board MCU and crappy
programming of that MCU. The UV-3Rs are software controlled radios (not
SDRs) the DSP isn't controllable beyond squelch thresholds (afaik) which
means only when and where to transmit and receive not any changes to
modulation or demodulation.

  - pads can be fragile or lift off easily.
    [User:haxwithaxe](User:haxwithaxe "wikilink") recommends using a
    nonsolder based means of connection.
  - code: [on github](https://github.com/lelazary/UV3RMod)
  - feature set beyond stock firmware as of 2013/04/08 noonish [ripped
    from WISHLIST on
    github](https://github.com/lelazary/UV3RMod/blob/master/WISHLIST)
    - Quick interface to program rx freq, tx freq, power and PL code
      very quickly for repeaters. No offset, you just start with the rx
      freq and shift it by whichever amount you want. This will allow
      allow you to turn off the tx, or operate satellites. At any point
      during this mode, you can hold the mem channel and it will ask you
      which number you want to save this to.
    - Memory mode will allow you to go through your saved memory. At any
      point you can press menu and change more details about the
      channel. The details will include power with granular level, DTMF
      TX/RX, and other functions TBD. This mode will show the channel
      name and the freq underneath it.
    - Satellite Mode: Auto tuning of the frequency with response to the
      Doppler shift.
    - (not yet) Digital mode. Hopefully I could add some text base
      digital data for rx and tx. You might need to tx the text using
      morse code since there is no alpha numeric keypad on the radio.
      The digital mode will also include a store and repeat message
      forwarding.
    - (mostly implemented) Computer mode: All the functions of the radio
      including the RDA1846 registers, TX, and RX will be controlled
      through the serial port on the radio.
    - Fox/Hunt mode. Can be used to transmit a signal intermittently
      (like call sign morse code). Or send the RSSI signal into the
      audio, and with a directional antenna you can go hunting.
    - (not yet) Advance mode: Any RDA 1846 register can be set manually
      and saved for during startup.
    - (not yet) If the digital mode works, then RF programming of the
      radio. This will allow anyone to send you repeater information
      from their memory locations. I will work by selecting a memory
      channel to rx, and pressing a button. Then on another radio you
      can send the programming info.
    - (not yet) APRS mode: Boots straight to 144.39 mhz (or whatever you
      set it to), doesn't accept inputs, stays on the set frequency.

## Notes

- **DON'T BUY THE PROGRAMMING CABLE** you can use a 3.5mm stereo plug
  and a usb to serial device. (pinouts available
  [here](http://uv3r.com/))
- If you buy one the only working setup for using the manufacturer's
  programming software found by
  [User:haxwithaxe](User:haxwithaxe "wikilink") has been Windows7 with
  **Vista** drivers for the Prolific serial adapter.
  - others have had success with WINE and in XP but since many of the
    cables have counterfeit controllers they have varying levels of
    functionality with different drivers.
  - [User:haxwithaxe](User:haxwithaxe "wikilink") used a VirtualBox VM
    with usb pass through.

### Recommended Accessories

- A wide based flush fit BNC (or similarly durable connector) adapter
  (sometimes called an antenna saver) given the short mating cycle "SMA
  connectors are rated for up to 500 mating cycles" [citation via
  Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMA_connector)
  - example: [SMA Male to BNC Female
    Connector](http://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/m/mUgb7YRjFqInb9GoQZVkQMw/140.jpg)
  - Also you can replace the adapter much more easily than the SMA
    connection in the radio.
  - You can even apply some threadlock (the light duty stuff) to the
    threaded part and still keep the groundplane continuity because of
    the wide base on the adapter touching the rim of the SMA socket.
- Get a dedicated antenna for the VHF and UHF (or whichever you will use
  the most). The dedicated antennas will do wonders for performance as
  the stock antenna is really pretty horrible and multiband antennas in
  general can only be so good on any given band they are tuned for
  before the others suffer, so they end up being okay at best on all of
  them. If you followed the above then get a BNC terminated antenna and
  don't worry about adapters for the antennas.

## Hardware Versions

There are a large number of internally identical radios with very
nonstandardized names in the UV-3R and UV-5R family.

- UV-3R is the first iteration of the UV-3R series it is it's own beast
  for the most part
  - Mostly-clones UV-100 and UV-200
- UV-3R MKII is the next oldest and has several variants
  - UV-X4 - Just a rename for marketing?
  - UV-3R+ (aka UV-3R Plus or UV-3R + Plus)
    - different battery and charging method - has an actual charging
      cradle but battery type is not common
    - different audio jacks (separate speaker and mic/ptt)
    - female instead of male SMA (not RP-SMA)
- [UV-5R](HAM_HT_Baofeng_UV-5R "wikilink")
