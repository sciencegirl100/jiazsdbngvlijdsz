Note: non-public events and charging participants more than the cost of
materials are strongly discouraged at HacDC.

1.  Have an idea for an event. :) If your event is a [kit
    build](Running_a_Kit_Build "wikilink") or [lightning
    talks](LightningTalks_Howto "wikilink"), we have particular tips for
    you in addition to the ones on this page. If you're running a class,
    add the class description, including date and time and anything
    participants should bring, to
    [:Category:Classes](:Category:Classes "wikilink").
2.  Plan where and how to present your content. Options include the
    space's meeting room or workshop, the
    [auditorium](http://www.saintstephensdc.org/Meeting_Auditorium.html)
    (capacity: 200 people standing; 150 sitting in chairs in rows; 70
    sitting at tables), the
    [sanctuary](http://www.saintstephensdc.org/Meeting_Church.html)
    (capacity: 200 people sitting in pews; another 300 can stand or sit
    on floor), and the [dining
    room](http://www.saintstephensdc.org/Meeting_DiningRoom.html)
    (capacity: 300 people standing; 220 sitting in chairs in rows; 175
    sitting at tables).
3.  Assemble any necessary parts.
4.  Schedule a time
    1.  Use [the church's
        calendar](http://www.saintstephensdc.org/calendars.html) if you
        want to use the church's auditorium, dining room, or sanctuary.
    2.  **Use the [the HacDC event
        calendar](http://www.hacdc.org/calendar) to choose a date and
        time.** Please try not to overlap with other HacDC events. Also,
        please try to give potential participants at least a week's
        notice.
    3.  If you're not sure when to have your event, consider posting a
        poll to help you decide. [Doodle](http://doodle.com/) is one
        free and easy service for doing so.
5.  Publicize!
    1.  Send an e-mail to HacDC's public announcements,
        blabber@hacdc.org and (optionally, and an option only if sender
        is a current member) private members@hacdc.org, mailing lists.
    2.  Blog it on our Wordpress site (every member is entitled to a
        login for [our Wordpress
        dashboard](http://www.hacdc.org/wp-admin/)). That automatically
        [tweets it](https://twitter.com/hacdc) and sends an e-mail to
        HacDC's public blabber@ list via [If This Then
        That](https://ifttt.com).
    3.  Create a [HacDC Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/hac-dc/) event,
        which automatically adds it to the [the HacDC event
        calendar](http://www.hacdc.org/calendar).
    4.  Consider notifying other groups whose members might be
        interested. One place to check is [this list of DC-area geeky
        groups](http://barcamp.pbwiki.com/DC-Area-Geeky-Groups).
    5.  Get it listed on [DC Tech Events](http://dctechevents.com/) and,
        if possibly applicable to artists, send it to the [DorkbotDC
        Blabber](http://dorkbot.org/mailman/listinfo/dorkbotdc-blabber/)
        mailing list or let the overlord(s) know: dorkbotdc \[at\]
        dorkbot \[dot\] org.
6.  Post signs (e.g., on the red door) directing attendees who've never
    been to HacDC before.
7.  Run the event. Share your knowledge. Have fun. [Take some
    pictures.](http://www.flickr.com/groups/hacdc/)
    1.  At the event, please tell the participants who aren't members
        about what HacDC is and ask them to consider joining or donating
        to us. Not confident with your impromptu asking-for-money
        skills? Try our pre-scripted [Spiel](Spiel "wikilink").
8.  How did it go? [Blog](http://hacdc.org/) it! Have suggestions for
    next time? Add them here!
