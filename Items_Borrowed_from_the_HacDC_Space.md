Borrowed the FLIR One for Android infrared imager. Should be returned by
mid/late December.

<b>March 2018</b> - <b>[User:l_wl](User:l_wl "wikilink")</b>
Borrowed Hacdc posters (now returned). Borrowed the thermometer gun (now
returned, with new batteries no-less). Borrowed several slack lines
(will return these after I take a few cool videos of me slack lineing).

<b>January 2018</b> - <b>[User:l_wl](User:l_wl "wikilink")</b>
Borrowed Power Mac G5 to conduct repairs on. Will share a video on its
current state and improvments.

<b>8 December 2017</b> - <b>[tom](User:tom "wikilink")</b>
I've borrowed the dolly and the heatgun, need to return them both.

`   returned by May 2018 -t`

<b>March 2017</b> - <b>[l_wl)](l_wl) "wikilink")</b>
Borrowed an LCD screen for use as an additional monitor at home. I took
one LCD screen (that had VGA inputs) and replaced it with another LCD
screen (quite similar to the one I took, but possibly lower in quality)
(as this one had HDMI inputs - that my PC can't handle.). I have also
brought an additional small monitor to the space (March 2018). \[Could
some let me know if this suffices?\]

<b>30 August 2017</b> - <b>[mirage335](User:mirage335 "wikilink")</b>
Biosignal amplifier was returned a long time ago, hopefully it will be
treated well. Non-flyable quadcopter, legos, high-power audio amps were
also returned long ago, though the seem not to be in the space at
present. Also, have been borrowing stick welder, both in hopes of
testing it, and to keep it out of the way of basement cleanup projects.
Need for high-current 240V service has held up that project.

<b>27 September 2016</b> - <b>[Ethan

USRP1 for Spaceblimp communications experimentation

<b>1 July 2016</b> - <b>[Tom Iddings](User:Tom "wikilink")</b>
Borrowed a Dell D620 to put GNU/Hurd on it because it seemed like a good
use for it. Maybe we can use it for an experimental OS development
project?

<b>17 May 2016</b> - <b>[Ethan Waldo](User:ewaldo "wikilink")</b>
Borrowed Altera DE2-115 to assist in further developing
[OpticalTableRobot](:Category:OpticalTableRobot "wikilink")

<b>10 February 2016</b> -
<b>[mirage335](User:Mirage335 "wikilink")</b>
Borrowed T43 laptop used to drive pen plotter and remaining biosignal
amplifier development components.

<b>14 October 2015</b> - <b>[mirage335](User:Mirage335 "wikilink")</b>
Borrowed miniVNA and extender to calibrate and optimally point a
moderately-directional wideband antenna. EDIT: Returned a long time ago.

<b>16 September 2015</b> -
<b>[mirage335](User:Mirage335 "wikilink")</b>
Temporarily storing a bunch of stuff from HacDC, to relieve some of the
temporary storage pressure during the move. Most prominently,our
biosignal amplifier, a bunch of high-power audio amps, a couple
non-flyable quadcopters, a RC hovercraft toy, a telescope, some more
legos, some toy night-vision goggles, the NI myDAQ/myDSP, and some IP
cams. Will return upon request, hopefully sooner. Hopefully most of this
stuff (ie. biosignal amplifier audio amps, IP cams, myDAQ/myDSP, etc)
will be immediately integrated into the new classroom soon after the
move. EDIT: NI myDAQ/myDSP returned along time ago. Returned the
telescope, night-vision goggles, and IP cams.

<b>11 June 2015</b> - <b>[mirage335](User:Mirage335 "wikilink")</b>
Returned label printer, which is not useful without a special adapter
cable among other things. Borrowed a bag of legos and empty microscope
head for optical prototyping and photolithography experiments. Most
Legos will probably be returning after replacement by 3D printed parts.
Will return upon request.

<b>27 March 2015</b> - <b>[mirage335](User:Mirage335 "wikilink")</b>
Long-term borrowed amphibious RC car, power-line monitor, and label
printer. Will return upon request.

<b>17 March 2015</b> - <b>[wa1ivd](User:Wa1ivd "wikilink")</b>
Borrow Tektronix 2212 ser. H701215 from basement for Ultimate3S project,
will return if needed.

<b>10 March 2015</b> - <b>[mirage335](User:Mirage335 "wikilink")</b>
Returned remaining screwdrivers and such. Borrowed an average
oscilloscope, and low-end function generator long term, will return upon
request or when tolerance for their existance at the space improves (eg.
for a class event). Also borrowed one of the several wire-wrapping tools
recent discovered.

<b>3 March 2014</b> - <b>[mirage335](User:Mirage335 "wikilink")</b>
USRP, related radio gear (some of which was built by me), wire,
low-quality soldering iron, 2.4GHz R/C transmitter/receiver pair.
Attempting to set up ham radio antenna at new QTH. Additionally, going
to try repairing a model R/C plane with the R/C transmitter/receiver
pair. Will return unused radio gear and supplies to HacDC when done, and
donate for anything used. EDIT: Have returned some of the supplies as of
3/28/2014. Still borrowing USRP and soldering iron. RC plane may be able
to use R/C transmitter/receiver pair if given new servomotors. Also
borrowed a pair of decent pilers and wire cutters. EDIT: Borrowed SMT
tweezers as of 4/14/2014, since my own set may not be adequate for an
urgent project. Also borrowed M3 screwdriver bit. EDIT: Also borrowed
soldering iron tip, while waiting on RMA from two other tips. Will
probably bring back with some of the other materials within a week or
two, time-ultra-critical project still underway. EDIT: Have returned
almost everything. Still occasionally borrowing a few screwdrivers and
other non-critical items, as some of my own have failed.

Prusa Mendel, and associated hardware. Minor repairs in progress, ETA
return Thursday, January 2, 2014. EDIT: Returned Saturday, January 4,
2014. Performance and reliability vastly improved.

Prusa Mendel, PLA feedstock, M3 screws, some tape, some tools. Emergency
maintenance in progress, ETA return Thursday, April 24, 2013. EDIT:
Returned a while ago, seems the information was lost on wiki.

<b>April 4, 2013</b> - <b>[nocko](User:Nocko "wikilink")</b>
Diligent Spartan-3E Starter Board (Labeled HacDC \#12). I want to see if
the SUMP logic analyser HDL can be modified and installed on this board.

<b>December 18, 2012</b> -
<b>[mirage335](User:Mirage335 "wikilink")</b>
Project Salvage components. Most should become valuable electronic test
equipment at HacDC and absolutely must not be trashed. EDIT: Returned a
while ago to the test cart. Connectorization of some parts (eg. mixers)
still progressing.

<b>July 21, 2012</b> - <b>[mirage335](User:Mirage335 "wikilink")</b>
Borrowing Ham radio gear this weekend, as described in the previous
struck through entry. EDIT: Returned. Awesome data obtained.

<b>June 29, 2012</b> - <b>[mirage335](User:Mirage335 "wikilink")</b>
<s>Borrowing Ham radio gear tomorrow. Specifically, IC-718 radio,
antenna tuner, RF power meter, balun (if available), PSU, some feedline,
some wire, and a measuring tape (if \>12'). Will also borrow some of my
own objects at the space, specifically a UPS (for its 12V battery) and a
magnetic loop antenna. Leaving my name and number on the ham radio cart
in case anyone needs the radio or has questions. This is exclusively for
the purpose of diagnosing HacDC's ham radio issues as documented on the
mailing list.</s> Postponed due to severe weather and power disruption.
Radio not borrowed yet.

<b>May 30, 2012</b> - <b>[mirage335](User:Mirage335 "wikilink")</b>
- Ancient (20 years+) semi-working AM/FM/WB/CB radio. Found in basement.
AM function never worked, in sorry shape, needs repair, so I'm going to
try repairing it as far as possible. Will be back at the space in ~2
weeks. EDIT: Returned. After mostly mechanical repairs, AM, FM, CB
functions work well.

'cause, you know, all the cool kids were doing it.
I discovered that the unit I borrowed is flaky - after a few seconds of
wearing it while powered up the display flickers and goes dead. I think
that the cable leading from the power pack to the visor has a bad
connection. When I get time I'll tear this one down and see if I can
repair it.
