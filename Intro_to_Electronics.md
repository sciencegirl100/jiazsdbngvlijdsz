## Concept

The idea behind this course structure is for six sessions held a week
apart. In order to provide a tangible end for students to feel like
they???re working toward, each week will have a project; students will
be walked through building that project and completing it by the end of
the session.

In that sense, each week stands alone — a project started in one week
does not need a future week in order to be complete. That said, later
projects will depend on the knowledge gained in previous projects, and
some of them will even be based on previous projects. (For example,
[Week 5???s
project](Intro_to_Electronics#Week_5:_Digital_logic "wikilink") is a
Larson scanner, and it uses [Week 4???s
project](Intro_to_Electronics#Week_4:_Oscillators_.E2.80.94_and_the_venerable_555 "wikilink")
— a typical 555-based astable multivibrator circuit — to provide its
clock signal.)

The course starts with a few basic circuit components (a voltage source,
a resistor and an LED) and an explanation of typical prototyping
equipment (breadboard and multimeter) and builds up to include regulated
power supplies, basic optoelectronics and eventually digital logic.

It does not (at least in this draft) include much in the way of detailed
exploration of analog electronics; it???s intended more as an
introduction to the field of hobbyist electronics as a whole and to an
assortment of the basic components one might find in a variety of
projects.

Suggestions are, of course, welcome, as are other potential projects to
use in place of some of the ones listed here. (In particular, a good
introductory op-amp project might be handy to have.) I???ve listed
[component prices](Intro_to_Electronics#Components "wikilink") for 25
students; my goal would be to keep the cost per student at \$25 or less
— preferably more in the \$20 range.

    - Remember to limit current
  - **Hands-on:** Light one
    - Probably just rebuild [Week 1's
      circuit](Intro_to_Electronics#Week_1:_Getting_familiar_with_components "wikilink")
      ([schematic here (tested April 2,
      2012](Media:Intro_to_Electronics-Week3-0-LED.svg "wikilink")),
      though you really don't even need the switch for this

    - Should look essentially identical to [the EMSL
      circuit](http://www.evilmadscientist.com/article.php/nightlight),
      except that we'll keep a current-limiting resistor in series with
      the LED
    - Note: This phototransistor (like many others) is mainly sensitive
      to infrared and will consider a room lit only by fluorescent bulbs
      to be "dark". Bring around a different lamp to test the projects.

  - **Hands-on (ish):** Compare the NOT gate schematic to our night
    light
    - We've made one with a phototransistor!

      regulator output voltage
  - **Another hands-on:** Replace one of the 555 frequency-setting
    resistors ([Schematic here (tested April 4,
    2012)](Media:Intro_to_Electronics-Week4-2-555-potentiometer.svg "wikilink"))
    - Change its resistance and watch what happens!

### Week 5: Digital logic

**Goal:** Build a Larson scanner (Schematic (more or less) from
[EMSL](http://www.evilmadscientist.com/article.php/CylonOLantern))

- Use [Week 4's 555
  project](Intro_to_Electronics#Week_4:_Oscillators_.E2.80.94_and_the_venerable_555 "wikilink")

    - Watch what happens — connect each output pin to an LED to make it
      more obvious ([schematic here (tested April 4, 2012) with
      different (i.e., faster) resistor values as suggested by
      EMSL](Media:Intro_to_Electronics-Week5-1-counter.svg "wikilink"))

    3](Intro_to_Electronics#Week_3:_Optoelectronics "wikilink"))
  - Why are we interested in these?
    - Plot out Larson scanner details/excitation table
  - We need four of them
  - **Hands-on:** Add them to the circuit ([Schematic here (tested April

- Bonus: Do I need one of these? (Other ways to mount circuits)
  - Prototyping board, layout tools, etching (chemical and mechanical)

## Bill of materials

Pricing assumes 25 kits with no special discounts (e.g., [Adafruit
hackerspace
discount](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/2010/06/01/big-news-all-hacker-spaces-in-the-world-get-adafruit-reseller-pricing-starting-today/)).
Total cost — not including breadboard jumpers, multimeter, PCB and
shipping for all of these things — comes out to \$368.20 (or \$14.73 per
person).

### Equipment

- Multimeter
  - Relatively inexpensive (but maybe more than we want students to
    spend)
  - Voltage, current, resistance, continuity
    - Diode test would be nice to have
  - Do we want people to get their own, or do we want to use the
    space's?
    - MAS830 (\$337.50 for 25:
      [Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com/products/71))
    - Does the space have enough working meters? (If not, can we
      convince some place to donate some more?)
- Breadboard
  - Full size x1 (\$180 for 25:
    [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/products/239))
- Battery holder
  - 4xAA x1 (\$21.18 for 25:
    [Digi-Key](http://search.digikey.com/us/en/products/BH14AAW/BH14AAW-ND/66735))
- Batteries
  - Alkaline AA x4 (\$33.48 for 100-pack:
    [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Duracell-Coppertop-MN1500-Batteries-Count/dp/B006W9QIM2/))

### Things we could make ourselves

- Assorted breadboard jumpers
  - We could cut these ourselves to reduce cost, assuming we have enough
    small solid-core wire
  - Apparently Digi-Key also sells these in [packs of 150 or
    200](http://search.digikey.com/us/en/cat/prototyping-products/jumper-wire/2359516?stock=1&pbfree=1&rohs=1)
    for various lengths for \$16.48
    - Beginners might be more comfortable with longer pieces of wire
      (e.g., [these packs of 75](http://www.adafruit.com/products/153)
      for \$6.00 each), though — thoughts?
- Printed circuit board for [Week
  6](Intro_to_Electronics#Week_6:_Soldering "wikilink")
  - Do we etch or mill these ourselves? Do we have some batch PCB
    service (e.g., Seeed, Sparkfun) get them done?
  - First design (EAGLE files [here](https://gist.github.com/2067344))
    is 1.70 x 3.00 inches
    - BatchPCB price at that size for 25: \$328.75 (\$13.15 each)
    - Fusion PCB price at that size for 30: \$84.70 (\$2.83 each)
      - Fusion PCB price at that size for 50: \$84.90 (\$1.70 each)
      - Both Fusion PCB prices are with the extra fee for testing all of
        them (instead of half) since it'd be nice not to have to
        troubleshoot the boards themselves in addition to the students'
        work
    - Still have some room in the corner if we're interested in doing
      anything else with it

### Components

  - 5mm red x10 (\$19.38 for 250:

    (Note: We only need SPST, but for some reason those are several
    times more expensive. Not sure why that is. SPDT will take a tad
    more explanation, but it shouldn't be that big of a deal.)
