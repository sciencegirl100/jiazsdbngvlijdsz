- Printed Reprap Wilson Z Brace. Failed becuase cartridge ran out of
  filament. Refilled filament making sure not to wind it too tightly
  (Did by hand). Also made sure to release tension on wound filament
  very few winds by counter rotation cartridge.

- James reports: Attempted to print LCD Knob for Reprap Wilson but
  printer refused to start printing with a "Cartridge Empty" error
  message. Need to procure another cartridge and being doing cartridge
  swap procedure to bypass this check.

- James reports: Printed Y bearing holders from Prusa Mendel upgrade.
  New mirrored build surface is working well with Elmers glue stick
  (Easier to release parts). Several failed attempts at printing
  filament bypass for cube because of poor STL file orientation.

- James reports: Printer is operating well. There is slight warping of
  larger 4 inch parts on the corners but prints complete successfully.
  The part I was printing failed in a strange way (printed part was
  missing a geometric section). This might be due to forgetting to run
  heal in the software. Also when transferring the .cube file to the
  printer just use the USB key as it is far more reliable than the wifi.

- James reports: Performed Bed Leveling procedure (Ugh!!). Printing
  Wilson Piecemeal Y Idler. The print looks a little smooshed on the
  bottom. Consider recalibrating Z a little higher.

- James reports: Printed 2nd part on this printer. Reset Z axis to 1.60z
  so that it wouldn't smoosh the part as much. seemes to have worked but
  has a little bit of warping of the edges of the 5" part I was
  printing. Removing the part is requiring long times in a water bath to
  permeate the glue underneath --[Nostromo](User:Nostromo "wikilink")
