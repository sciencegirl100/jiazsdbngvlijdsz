This is the documentation vertex for a 3D printer build run started in
July 2013.

Vital links and major log entries can be made here (by anyone, as
always). Detailed logs should be made either in a user's own log (which
should be linked from here). It'd be a good idea to consolidate what was
learned and place it on this page in the end.

## Goal

Get a few people together that want their own 3DP and build 'em.

The primary point is to get working, somewhat reliable machines running
in order to focus on using the printers. This may be a bit different
than many hackerspace builds that might focus on improving the 3DP
designs.

## Plan

1.  What model(s) to build?
2.  Find mentors. People that can help when we get stuck or review what
    we've done and suggest corrections.
3.  Create BOM, aka parts list
    1.  Catalog what parts we already have at HacDC.
    2.  Find supplier(s) or kits for all other parts.
4.  Set some form of gathering schedule or build timeline. (a little
    structure is good)

### Which model?

#### Deltas

- Rostock / Max

  Kossel seems to be an improvement
- Kossel (original)

  obsolete
- Kossel Mini

  current Kossel

  Looking at linear bearings / towers.. may need to pull something from
  the OpenBeam version

  Note: 'Mini' is a misnomer, scale it as you like.
- OpenBeam Kossel Pro

  in Kickstart phase

  David's top pick but Terrance (openbeam guy) understandably hasn't
  released a bom yet

#### Cartesian

- i3

  current Mendel design
- Mendel Max

  larger, beam-styled Mendel

#### Biomechanical

- Simpson

  Uses only rotary bearings, like biological entities such as you

  Some design concerns; wear at base rotation points, accuracy on reel
  drives

### Mentors / Guides

Unbeknowst to them, considering asking Julia and/or mirage.
