![<File:HacDC_Financials_2014_12.pdf>](HacDC_Financials_2014_12.pdf "File:HacDC_Financials_2014_12.pdf").
We gained Gary Sparkes (Hunter) as a new member, re-gained Ann
Millspaugh as a returning member, and lost Christine Prefontaine and
Phillip Walker. We have 44 dues-paying members in good standing and 6
dues-waived members.

The CFC charity application is proving non-trivial to complete. By
January 23 we must, in addition to the forms completed thus far:

- submit supporting statements and/or documentation of substantial local
  presence in the geographical area covered by the local campaign and a
  description of the programs, services, benefits, etc. provided by the
  organization in calendar year 2014 and how those programs, services,
  benefits, etc. affect human health and welfare of the target
  population.
- complete and submit a Pro Forma [IRS Form
  990](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f990.pdf). The following sections
  must be completed: Page 1, Items A-M; Part I (Summary and Part II,
  Signature Block), Lines 1-4 only; Part VII (Compensation section A
  only); Part VIII (Statement of Revenues); Part IX (Statement of
  Functional Expenses), and; Part XII (Financial Statements and
  Reporting).
- prohibit the sale or lease of CFC contributor lists

#### Project Awesome

Here is the Project Awesome spreadsheet for December:
![<File:HacDC_PA_Projects-2014_12.pdf>](HacDC_PA_Projects-2014_12.pdf "File:HacDC_PA_Projects-2014_12.pdf").
We continue to have to dip into savings to pay our rent, so no dividend
this month. :(

### Secretary's Report

No Report.

### Director-at-Large Reports

#### Travis

CNC will be running by end of the month. Prusa is running.

#### Zack

No report.

## [Project Awesome](:Category:Project_Awesome "wikilink") Reports

### Project LASER

No report. Hand-off required?

### Project BYZANTIUM

We're re-factoring the project. Slowly because we all have jobs now.

### Project KITBUILD

Nothing new to report. Still hoping to organize a kit build in concert
with a Learn to Solder event sometime this spring.

### Project SUPPLIES

Ordered replacement extruder for Rostock Max. Also ordered 0.35mm nozzle
for dramatically improved resolution.

When finances become less strained, a Rev.7 PCB heater would be a nice
addition. More even heating across the glass would reduce thermal stress
and greatly improve adhesion.

### Project EXPANSION

Still conservative.

### Project HAMRADIO

Don has installed a 2 element 10m and a 160m dipole antenna. Don fitted
a narrow (CW) filter in the main HF radio to improve narrow signal
performance. We have participated in a number of on-air contests and
contacted more than 100 countries.

## Member Reports

### mirage335

#### Lessons from Kamal Jain of Lowell Makes

Met Kamal Jain from [Lowell Makes](http://lowellmakes.com/),
Massachusetts hackerspace last month. Among other things, we discussed
revenue/sponsor structures. Recently received email detailing these
opportunities. In particular, we should look into
[1](https://doublethedonation.com/blog/2014/08/donation-requests/).

#### Shimmer

HacDC server Shimmer is proving stable. Please contact me by email
(directly or members@hacdc.org) for an account.

#### RFID

NetPLC boards and parts are in, so RFID system will be implemented soon.

## Old Business

## New Business

### Cams

Funding and installation of 'lights-on' cameras, and authorize BoD to
examine other relevant footage (ie. hallway cams) to correlate
incidents. Members' identities would not be recorded in any way not
already documented (ie. hallway cam).

This proposal is not a plan of action (ie. we may not need to buy cams),
just a provision for future improvement.

Approved the installation of camera. Funding and technical details to be
revisited.

### Dues Structure

We may benefit from some sort of multi-level membership structure,
perhaps particularly to ensure fair compensation for renting the office
space.

Needs to be discussed and revisited in a separate meeting.

### Increase Dues by \$10 for one year

Approved.
