## Approval of Previous Meeting's Minutes

## Recognition

- HacDC Members and Volunteers: This year we had a whole new board. We
  applied, appealed and were accepted as a Combined Federal Campaign
  charity, renewed our non-profit status with DC, fixed some years-old
  problems with our finances paperwork even after we lost our treasurer
  mid-year and had a horrible transition. We gained three sponsors this
  year: Lulzbot, Accelebrate and Newark element 14. We put up a
  microwave tower on the roof, the radio transceiver online and took a
  large-format laser cutter from design to operational project. Plus we
  significantly cleaned up the basement, moved much of the workshop down
  there, updated our inventory, moved the classroom to another suite and
  built custom shelving for it. On top of all those accomplishments,
  between 3D Thursdays, Amateur Radio and Microcontroller Mondays, HacDC
  has held about 100 free, public workshops in 2015. This doesn't
  include all the Radio Contests, Field Days and Licensing Exam
  Sessions, Capture The Flag, Web Scraping, SEM Workdays, the Intro
  Security Workshop, the Raspberry Jam, CNC Mill Class, Lockpicking,
  Virtual Reality Night, Table Top Gaming, our table at the Columbia
  Heights Farmers Market many Saturdays, and participation at the
  Greenbelt Maker Faire, the Silver Spring Maker Faire and nearly two
  full days at the National Maker Faire. So for all the hardships and
  frustrations we've had this year, thank you to everyone who makes
  HacDC awesome.

## Director Reports

### President's Report

### Vice President's Report

Ok, so I have been too hot under the collar about this lately, so I'll
step back from leading the charge. Please give some thought to improving
basement/shop policy.

Also, obtained copies of
![<File:MakersmithsRules.pdf>](MakersmithsRules.pdf "File:MakersmithsRules.pdf"),
![<File:MakersmithsDisclaimer.pdf>](MakersmithsDisclaimer.pdf "File:MakersmithsDisclaimer.pdf"),
and
![<File:MakersmithsSignIn.pdf>](MakersmithsSignIn.pdf "File:MakersmithsSignIn.pdf")
sheet. Please consider these documents as rough examples.

Members, please consider the impact of negativity towards the successful
OpticalTableRobot, as well as the concerns of hard working volunteers
who have sometimes endured more debate or distraction than support.

BoD candidates, please consider the need to form a cohesive body of
leadership for HacDC.

HacDC has a lot of options right now, both in terms of equipment and
goals.

HacDC has the potential to offer advanced tooling and support quality
research. Or, HacDC can focus on less difficult, perhaps less polarzing
aspects of its mission. In the former case, we need to make
basement/shop areas more insulated from politics and recklessness. In
the latter case, it would make sense to liquidate assets that will not
be used, such as the OpticalTableRobot, extra electronics test
equipment, high-voltage transformers, etc.

## Audit Committee Report

The Committee will update the members on progress thus far and discuss
the plan forward.

## Member Reports

- Enrique. Hosted two Introduction to Linux nights. Attendance was very
  sparse though; maybe 7 people total. Also Kerbal Space Program. I've
  asked Brian about improving signage to direct people to HacDC from the
  St. Stephen's main entrance because I found one attendee pacing back
  and forth there looking for the address. Let's open the Newark stuff
  and take some photos! Also Julia, myself, and Dan and a few volunteers
  fixed the TV! I made a video. If people like it maybe it'll be online.

## Old Business

### Membership Dues Waiver for EdTechDMV / Representative

- Old problem, new example: An outside organization wants to use HacDC
  facilities during business hours. The organization is EdTechDMV, an
  educational non-profit organization, wants to offer IT workshops and
  computer training classes in HacDC's classroom. The two examples are
  an upcoming workshop the evening of February 17th, and computer
  training classes during 9-5 hours they want to offer this summer. Are
  these events something HacDC wants to facilitate/host? What are the
  pros and cons? If we do, how would we give EdTechDMV access to the
  classroom when members are not available?

### Bylaws Amendment

- Proposed Amendment to Bylaws Article II, Section 6: Add "*For
  substantial cause, the Board of Directors may indefinitely suspend a
  member's access to the space by a 2/3 majority vote of the board. By
  voting at an official meeting with quorum, members may reinstate or
  suspend, access or membership, for any member whose access has been
  suspended by the board. The board may suspend the access of no more
  than two members per month via this procedure. Access to the space may
  not be re-suspended by the Board of Directors for the same actions or
  incidents. Explanation of such suspensions must be submitted
  electronically to all members."* (This proposed bylaws amendment must
  be signed by 3/4ths of all members before it is adopted)

### Restrict Workshop and Tool Access

- Approve a *non-binding resolution* that access to the workshop in the
  basement should be restricted to HacDC members who have undergone a
  safety briefing and use of certain tools (CNC Mill, Lathe, PCB Etch
  Supplies, OTR) restricted to members authorized by an approved
  custodian of each tool (to be determined).

Proposal text was send via email to members was was approved by large
majority: "I propose that we change the access control policy to the
basement, establishing a "basement custodian", who has the authority to
control who has access to the basement, and the responsibility to
restrict access to those who are able to use the equipment and space
without being a disturbance to the use of the machinery and space by
others. Regarding my second proposal, I would like the initial basement
custodian to be selected by the board, with replacements selected by the
standing custodian. The board should be empowered to replace the
custodian only through a membership vote at a membership meeting with
quorum." This proposal was approved by a large majority vote, with the
understanding that the custodian is subject to replacement at the next
meeting if members are not satisfied with the rules and procedures
required to certify members for basement access before then. The
custodian was renamed Dungeon Master. The board voted to appoint Julia
as the first Dungeon Master.

### Reimbursements

- Approve reimbursement of \$95.14 to Enrique for purchase of an 8' step
  ladder for basement use. (replaced 8' wooden ladder) - This was
  Approved.
- Approve \$2,000 for fully recomissioning the OpticalTableRobot. - This
  was Tabled.
- Approve \$500 for an off-the-shelf throw-away eBay laser cutter. -
  This was Tabled.

## New Business

- Colloboratively discuss, consider, and adopt policy reforms to protect
  volunteer contributions to the basement/shop areas.
- Invited speakers. The Amateur Radio club finds and hosts invited
  speakers monthly and I think that's something HacDC could do even more
  often. What topics are we interested in hearing about? Off the top of
  my head: quantum computing, and something a bit more social like
  epistemology online.
- Review our year long experiment of having \$60 dues, and possibly vote
  on whether to continue requiring \$60. - This was temporarily approved
  for the month.
