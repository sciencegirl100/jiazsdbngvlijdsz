# Upward Facing Camera

This flight's payload featured an upward facing camera to gain a better
understanding of what goes on with the balloon, rigging, and parachute
during the flight.

##### Balloon Expansion

The balloon's diameter at the burst altitude is 3.43 times its diameter
at the launch altitude. Assuming the balloon is a sphere with a 1 meter
radius at launch, its starting volume is 4.19 m3. This means the
balloon's volume at burst is 169.03 m3, an expansion to 40.34 times the
launch volume.

# Current Mission

Since [Global Space Balloon Challenge 2016
(GSBC)](https://www.balloonchallenge.org) just ended, there is no better
time than now to start
[planning](HacDC_Spaceblimp_6/Projects "wikilink") for participation in,
but not limited to, the GSBC 2017 challenge. HacDC has had some
preliminary discussions with the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL)
regarding some of their STEM initiatives which align well with our
Spaceblimp project. This presents a great opportunity for HacDC to
collaborate with the NRL and local area schools to assist students in
preparing for the next GSBC or other balloon events. Besides helping
young minds grow, we could also expand in to other STEAM initiatives and
work side-by-side with distinguished researchers and scientists from the
NRL.

Supplies and equipment are not an issue. Hands on help is. We need
embedded hardware, software, FPGA, and RF engineers, licensed amateur
radio operators, project developers, crafts people, decorators,
coordinators, outreach specialists and educators. However, no one with
helping hands or a willingness to learn will be turned away.
